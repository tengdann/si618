A FEW GENERAL REMARKS.


THE object of this volume is to present to the public a number of
attractive receipts in a form so clear and concise as to render their
execution practicable and comparatively easy. This is a need which we
believe has long been felt; those books of value on the subject of
cookery hitherto published generally having been written in French,
and those which have appeared in English, while perhaps containing
something of merit, usually so abound in the use of technical terms
as to harass and puzzle the inexperienced. The general directions
also are usually of such vague and incomprehensible a character as
to render their meaning quite unintelligible to the reader. In view
of these difficulties, we have endeavored to avoid those terms not
generally understood, and to condense each receipt as much as possible,
compatible with a clear and thorough understanding of the subject. We
have also studied simplicity of language, so that our book may come
within the comprehension of all classes, and that which we consider of
importance, to cooks themselves. We believe that we will not be met
with indignant protest in venturing to assert that cooking as an art
is greatly neglected in America, this fact being only too frequently
and universally deplored. The wealthy who may afford a _chef_, or very
experienced cook, are vastly in the minority of those who suffer from
the incapability of cooks, and also from the lack of knowledge on their
own part, leading to the neglect of one of the most important factors
of comfortable living. We think, however, that the number of people of
moderate income, desiring to live well, and yet within their means,
is very large; and it is to these, as well as to the more affluent,
that we hope this book may be of use, for, while economy is not its
_sole_ object, the variety of receipts for palatable dishes which may
be prepared at small cost is very large. On the other hand, of course,
there are a great number of dishes which are obviously expensive; but
these may be distinguished at a glance.

In conclusion, we would remark that, as we know the furnishings of
American kitchens to be very meager, we have forborne the mention of
particular utensils for the preparation of certain dishes. There are,
however, a few articles which are indispensable if the best results are
expected--viz., a Dutch oven, for roasting meats, poultry, and game,
_before_ the fire, and _not_ in the oven of the range, which bakes
instead of roasting, and so dries up the juices of the meats.

A mortar and pestle will also be required when "pounding" is
mentioned, as for chicken, meats, almonds, etc.

A fine sieve is necessary for the straining of sauces; and two flannel
bags, kept scrupulously clean, one for the purpose of straining soups
and the other for straining jellies.


SOUPS AND SAUCES.

It must be constantly borne in mind that soups must be always allowed
to simmer gently, and _never_ to boil fast, except where express
directions are given to that effect. Always be particular to remove
every particle of scum whenever it rises. When stock is put away on ice
to become cold for the next day's use, remove the fat on the top with a
spoon, wipe over the top of the jelly with a cloth dipped in hot water,
and then, with a dry cloth, wipe the jelly dry. It, however, seems to
us a good plan to keep the stock-pot always filled, the stock simmering
on the fire, so as to be at hand when needed for the preparation of
different soups and sauces. In fact, this seems almost indispensable
where a variety of dishes is required. The same rule in regard to slow
boiling also applies to sauces.


BROILING.

Be careful to always grease the bars of your gridiron before laying
on it the object to be broiled. It is better to broil on a gridiron
_before_ the fire than on one which is placed on top of the range.
Season with salt and pepper while broiling, and not after the object
is taken from the fire.


FRYING.

Be careful that your frying-pan is very clean, as anything adhering to
the bottom of the pan is apt to burn, and therefore spoil the object
to be fried. To fry well, the fat should always be very hot, as its
success depends entirely on this. To judge of the proper temperature
of the fat, when it becomes quite still, dip the prongs of a fork in
cold water, and allow a few drops to fall into the fat, which, if it
crackles, is sufficiently hot. Or, drop a small piece of bread into
the fat, and if it fries instantly a light brown, the desired result
is reached. Dripping and butter should be clarified before using, the
former in the following manner: Put the dripping in a saucepan, on
the fire, and when boiling pour it into a bowl, into which you have
previously put half a pint of cold water. When cold, with a knife cut
around the edge and remove the cake of dripping. Scrape off all the
sediment adhering to the bottom of the cake, which wipe dry with a
clean cloth.

Many persons prefer lard rather than dripping for frying.

Butter is clarified in the following manner: Put some butter in a
saucepan on the fire, and when boiling remove the scum from the top,
and pour the clear butter gently into the pan which is required for
use.

It is quite indispensable to good cooking that every dish requiring
to be served hot should never be allowed to wait in the kitchen, but
should be served with the greatest promptitude possible, as a dish
prepared with every imaginable care will be sure to fail of its effect
if served lukewarm or cold. The first quality in a cook, therefore,
should be punctuality, which should be encouraged and appreciated by
the guests.




_The receipts as here given are all for eight persons._




FRENCH DISHES FOR AMERICAN TABLES.




CHAPTER I.

_SOUPS._


1. =Consomme, or Stock.= Put in a stock-pot a roast fowl (or the
carcass and remains of a fowl), a knuckle of veal, three pounds of
beef, and three quarts of water. When the scum begins to rise, skim
carefully until it quite ceases to appear. Then add a carrot, a
turnip, an onion, a leek, two cloves, a little celery, and a little
salt. Simmer very gently four hours. Remove every particle of grease,
and strain through a flannel kept for the purpose. This soup is the
foundation of most soups and sauces. To clarify: when necessary that
the soup should be very clear, clarify it in the following manner:
Put in a saucepan a pound of chopped raw beef (off the round is
preferable), which mix with an egg and two glasses of water, and pour
into your consomme. Simmer very gently for an hour, and strain.

2. =Bouillon, or Beef Broth.= Put into a stock-pot three pounds of
a shin of beef, one pound of a knuckle of veal, and three quarts of
water, and simmer gently. As soon as the scum begins to rise, skim
carefully until it quite ceases to appear. Then add salt, two carrots,
the same of onions, leeks, turnips, and a little celery. Simmer gently
four hours, strain, and serve.

3. =Bouillon Maigre.= Take six medium-sized carrots, as many turnips, a
bunch of celery, and two leeks. Boil them in water for a few moments,
drain, put them in cold water for a moment, after which put them into
three quarts of water, adding two cloves, and boil gently three hours.
Add a little salt, put through a sieve, heat again on the fire, and
serve.

4. =Bouillon Maigre of Fish.= Put into three quarts of water two pounds
of black bass, two pounds of pike, and one pound of eels. Add to these
two onions, two carrots, one head of celery, two cloves, and a little
salt. Simmer gently for two hours, and strain. This bouillon is used as
a foundation for all soups and sauces composed of fish.

5. =Pot-au-Feu.= Put into a saucepan three quarts of water, two pounds
of beef cut in slices, a fowl partially roasted, a knuckle of veal,
and a little salt. Simmer gently, and as soon as boiling begins, skim
carefully. Add two carrots, two turnips, two leeks, a few branches of
celery, an onion stuck with two cloves, and boil four hours. Drain your
vegetables carefully, remove every particle of grease from your soup,
strain, pour it over your vegetables, and serve.

6. =Soup a la Julienne= (Vegetable Soup). Divide two medium-sized
carrots in two, then cut into very thin slices of about an inch long;
take the same quantity of turnips, leeks, onions, and a few pieces
of celery, all cut into thin slices, and put them into a saucepan,
with a piece of good butter, on a gentle fire, stir softly until the
vegetables begin to color slightly, add three pints of consomme (or
stock, Art. 1), and boil gently one hour. Ten minutes before serving
put in three or four leaves of lettuce, the same of sorrel, and a
little chervil chopped up, boil a little longer, adding a pinch of
sugar, and a tablespoonful of green peas previously boiled.

7. =Soup a la Printaniere.= This soup is made exactly as the foregoing,
except with the addition of asparagus-tops to the other vegetables,
which, instead of being in slices, are cut out in fancy shapes with a
vegetable-cutter, which may be procured at any hardware-shop.

8. =Soup a la Brunoise.= Cut into square pieces, as small as possible,
a carrot, a turnip, an onion, a leek, and a few pieces of celery. Stew
gently in a saucepan with a little butter, stir softly until beginning
to color lightly, drain, and put into three pints of consomme (see Art.
1), which boil gently for an hour, skim off the grease carefully, and
serve.

9. =Soup a la Paysanne.= Take two tablespoonfuls of white beans, the
same of green peas. Cut in slices a carrot, a little celery, a turnip,
a leek, a cucumber, and a few string-beans; add a dozen little onions
and a pinch of sugar. Put these into three pints of consomme (or
stock), which boil gently an hour. Before serving you may add a few
pieces of bread cut in small squares and fried in butter.

10. =Soup with (farcied) Lettuce.= Boil ten moderate-sized lettuce,
then dip them in cold water, drain and press the water from them.
Separate them in two, season with a little pepper and salt, then lay a
tablespoonful of farce on the half of one lettuce, and cover with the
other half. Wrap up each lettuce with a piece of _very thin_ larding
pork, place them carefully in a saucepan containing half a pint of
consomme (or stock, Art. 1), and a few branches of parsley, inclosing
a clove of garlic, three pepper-corns, three cloves, and tie all
together. After boiling gently an hour, drain the lettuce, remove the
larding pork, the parsley, and its seasoning. Have boiling three pints
of consomme (Art. 1), into which place your lettuce, and serve. It
would be well to tie the larding pork around the lettuce, so that the
farce should not escape.

11. =Farce.= Place in a saucepan four ounces of very fresh bread-crumbs
and a cup of consomme (or stock, Art. 1). Simmer gently for ten
minutes, at the end of which time stir constantly with a wooden spoon,
and boil for ten minutes longer, so as to form a soft paste. This done,
put it on a plate to cool. Take four ounces of the breast of a chicken,
from which remove the skin and sinews, and pound extremely fine. Add
to this your bread-crumbs, in quantity about three quarters as much as
you have of chicken, and pound together until well mixed; season with
a little salt and white pepper, a very little nutmeg, and a piece of
butter. Then pound again, adding by degrees two eggs, until you have
obtained a fine, smooth paste. This mixture is used for all farces of
chicken. Veal, fish, and game are treated in the same manner. Quenelles
are also made of this mixture, by forming it into small balls, and
poaching them in boiling water for two minutes.

12. =Sorrel Soup= (clear). Wash a good handful of sorrel, which chop
up together with a lettuce and a teaspoonful of chopped chervil, and
put in a saucepan with half an ounce of butter. When beginning to
color lightly, add three pints of consomme (or stock, Art. 1), and
boil gently twenty minutes. Add a pinch of sugar, and skim the grease
carefully from your soup. Serve with small squares of bread fried in
butter a light brown.

13. =Cucumber Soup with Green Peas.= Cut two cucumbers in small pieces,
and, adding a pinch of sugar, cook in a little stock for about half an
hour, then add a pint of green peas, previously boiled, and serve in
three pints of consomme (or stock, Art. 1).

14. =Soup a la Pluche de Cerfeuil= (Chervil Soup). Fry in butter pieces
of bread cut in small squares, after which drain them. Pick and clean
a handful of chervil, and, taking only the ends of the leaves, serve,
together with bread, in three pints of consomme.

15. =Potage aux Pointes d'Asperges= (Asparagus Soup). Take from two
bunches of asparagus only the small green ends, wash them, and then
put them in a saucepan in boiling water with a little salt, and a very
little soda, so as to make them very green. Then, having thoroughly
boiled them, put them for a moment in cold water, drain, and serve them
in three pints of consomme (Art. 1), and add small squares of bread
fried in butter.

16. =Croutes au Pot.= Cut a carrot, a turnip, and a few pieces of
celery in small pieces, blanch them in hot water, drain them, and boil
with three pints of consomme (or stock, Art. 1); take four French
rolls, which divide in two, taking out all the soft part, and butter
the inside. Put them in the oven, and, as soon as they become browned,
serve them in your consomme, with the addition of a tablespoonful of
green peas previously boiled.

17. =Consomme with Poached Eggs.= Put in a saucepan with some boiling
water a tablespoonful of vinegar and a pinch of salt, in which poach
eight eggs. Then take them out and put them in cold water, so as to
pare the whites perfectly round, lay them again in hot water for a
moment, and serve in three pints consomme (Art. 1).

18. =Consomme Royal.= Break into a bowl two eggs, with which mix
thoroughly half a glass of milk. Butter a little saucepan, into which
strain your eggs and milk. Then put your saucepan into a flat pan,
which you have half filled with boiling water, and place in a moderate
oven for about thirty minutes. Take it out to cool, and when cold, cut
in little squares, and serve in three pints of consomme (see Art. 1).
If desired, add a handful of green peas, a few thin slices of carrots,
a few string-beans cut in diamond-shapes, or a few green ends of
asparagus, all previously boiled.

19. =Soup a la Princesse.= Boil a fowl in a little stock for two hours.
Take it out and let it become cold. Boil two tablespoonfuls of barley,
which afterward put in cold water for a moment. Also boil about a
handful of green peas. Cut the chicken into small pieces, after having
carefully removed all skin, and put into three pints of consomme (see
Art. 1), together with the barley and peas, boil for five minutes and
serve.

20. =Beef Soup.= Boil two ounces of barley with a little salt for ten
minutes, then put in cold water for a moment, cut into small squares
four ounces of cold beef, which, with the barley, and about an eighth
of a can of tomatoes, boil for ten minutes in three pints of consomme
(or stock, Art. 1), and serve.

21. =Vermicelli Soup.= Take four ounces of vermicelli, which boil in
hot water for twenty minutes, then put in cold water for a moment and
drain. Put three pints of consomme (Art. 1) in a saucepan, and, as soon
as it begins to boil, pour in the vermicelli; boil for ten minutes, and
serve.

22. =Vermicelli Soup with Green Peas.= Prepare as the foregoing, and
just before serving add eight tablespoonfuls of green peas previously
boiled.

23. =Farina Soup.= Add to three pints of boiling consomme (or stock,
Art. 1) two ounces of farina by degrees, stirring constantly with a
wooden spoon, so as to prevent thickening into lumps, and, after
boiling gently twenty minutes, serve.

24. =Arrowroot Soup.= Put in a saucepan four teaspoonfuls of arrowroot,
which moisten with a little cold stock, so as to form a smooth paste;
then add to it three pints of hot stock, taking care to stir with a
spoon from time to time, so as not to stick to the saucepan, and, after
boiling gently twenty minutes, serve.

25. =Soup with Italian Paste.= Take four ounces of Italian paste and
blanch in boiling water with a little salt for twenty minutes. Drain,
and put in three pints of consomme (see Art. 1), boil for ten minutes,
and serve.

26. =Sago Soup.= Take two ounces of sago, which boil gently in three
pints of consomme (see Art. 1) for thirty minutes, taking care to stir
constantly with a spoon; serve.

27. =Tapioca Soup.= Put in three pints of consomme (Art. 1) four ounces
of tapioca, which stir constantly; boil for forty minutes, and serve.

28. =Potage de Nouilles= (Noodle Soup). Take four ounces of flour, very
little salt, and two yolks of eggs, with which make a tolerably firm
paste. Roll it out very thin, taking care to sprinkle some flour on the
table, so that the paste does not stick. Fold it in two; cut it in very
thin slices of about an inch long, and blanch them in boiling water ten
minutes; after which put in cold water for a moment, drain, and serve
in three pints of boiling consomme (see Art. 1).

29. =Soup with Rice.= Take four ounces of rice, which wash well, then
boil for ten minutes, and put in cold water for a moment. Boil the rice
in three pints of consomme (see Art. 1) for forty minutes; skim and
serve.

30. =Rice Soup a la Creole.= Take six ounces of rice, which prepare as
the foregoing, and ten minutes before serving add about an eighth of a
can of tomatoes, and a little cayenne pepper; boil for a moment, and
serve.

31. =Chicken Consomme.= Take a chicken, cut it in pieces and put in a
saucepan with two quarts of water, and let it simmer gently until the
scum begins to rise, skim until every particle is removed; then add
salt, a carrot, an onion, a turnip, and a little celery. Boil gently
for two hours, strain, and serve.

32. =Chicken Giblet.= Cut a chicken, an onion, and a little ham, each
in small pieces. Put all together, in a saucepan, on the fire, and
add half an ounce of butter. When beginning to color slightly, add
three points of consomme (see Art. 1), and a pinch of rice; and, after
boiling three quarters of an hour, add two tablespoonfuls of tomatoes,
boil five minutes longer, and serve.

33. =Chicken Gumbo.= Cut in very small squares one ounce of raw ham
and an onion, which put in a saucepan, with a piece of butter, and
the wings of a chicken cut in small pieces. When beginning to color
slightly, add three pints of consomme (or stock, Art. 1) and a pinch
of barley. Boil an hour. Half an hour before serving, put in ten
okra-pods cut in slices, five tablespoonfuls of tomatoes, and a little
red pepper.

34. =Chicken Okra, with Oysters.= Prepare as the foregoing, without the
barley. Blanch two dozen oysters, which drain, and add to your soup
just before serving.

35. =English Mutton Broth.= Take half a pound of cold mutton and an
onion, cut each in very small pieces, and put in a saucepan with half
an ounce of butter. When beginning to color slightly, add three pints
of consomme (or stock, Art. 1), a carrot, and a turnip, cut in small
even pieces. Boil an hour, skim off the grease, and just before serving
add two ounces of barley previously boiled.

36. =Mullagatawny Soup.= Cut into small pieces an onion, a carrot, a
few pieces of celery, and a slice of ham, which put in a saucepan on a
moderate fire, with half an ounce of butter, until they begin to color
slightly. Add one quart of consomme (or stock, Art. 1) and boil for an
hour; add a pinch of curry, a little mullagatawny paste, which moisten
with a little cold stock, and, after adding a pint of stock, boil for
five minutes, and serve. Cold mutton, veal, or chicken, cut in small
pieces, may be added to this if desired.

37. =French Ox-tail Soup.= Cut an ox-tail in small pieces, also an
onion, and put in a saucepan with a little butter. When they begin to
color slightly, add three pints of consomme (or stock) and boil gently
for two hours. Skim off the grease, add one ounce of barley which you
have previously boiled, and about an eighth of a can of tomatoes; boil
ten minutes, and serve.

38. =English Ox-tail Soup.= Proceed as for the foregoing, except
instead of consomme add three pints of Spanish sauce (see Art. 80),
with very little thickening. Boil for two hours, and add a little
barley, a little salt, a carrot, previously boiled and cut in slices,
and four tablespoonfuls of tomatoes. Twenty minutes before serving add
a good glass of sherry, boil for a moment, and serve.

39. =Mock-Turtle Soup.= Take a scalded calf's head, boil it in hot
water for twenty minutes, drain, and put it in cold water. Then place
it in a saucepan with three quarts of water, a carrot, an onion,
four cloves, three cloves of garlic, a few branches of parsley,
a tablespoonful of vinegar, and a little salt. Mix well three
tablespoonfuls of flour in a little water, which add to the other
ingredients and boil gently for an hour and a half. Drain, and when
cold cut the calf's head into small pieces. Then add three pints
Spanish sauce (see Art. 80), boil gently twenty minutes, and, just
before serving, also add one good glass of sherry, a little red pepper,
and two hard-boiled eggs chopped up, the yolks and whites separately,
and the peel of a lemon cut in small pieces.

40. =Calf's-feet Soup.= Blanch two calf's feet for ten minutes,
then put them in cold water for a moment. Afterward place them in a
saucepan, with an onion, a carrot, a pinch of thyme, a bay-leaf, a
clove of garlic, a little parsley, the juice of a lemon, and a little
salt. Boil about an hour, or until very tender, and let them cool.
Then cut the calf's feet in small pieces, which put in three pints of
boiling consomme (or stock), with the addition of two wineglasses of
sherry, and serve.

41. =American Green-Turtle Soup.= Take a turtle, and let it bleed for
six hours, taking care that the head hangs downward. Then divide the
two shells, pressing your knife on the lower one so as not to disturb
the intestines, which take entire and throw immediately away. Detach
the fins and fleshy parts, putting aside any not needed for the soup,
and which may be put to use afterward in an entree, or broiled. After
having cleaned them put them in a saucepan, with a sufficient quantity
of water to cover them. Boil them, taking care to see from time to time
that the shells of the fins detach themselves. Put them in cold water
for a moment, drain, and cut them in small pieces, which place in a
saucepan, with three pints of consomme (or stock, Art. 1). Boil gently
for three hours, add four glasses of sherry and some Spanish sauce (see
Art. 80). Boil hard four eggs, pound the yolks, adding a little salt
and pepper, and the yolk of a raw egg. Form this mixture into little
balls, putting a little flour on your hands to roll them. Poach them
in boiling water, throw them into your soup, and, after boiling an
instant, serve.

42. =Green-Turtle Soup a la Londonderry.= Proceed as for the foregoing,
but instead of Spanish sauce add three pints of consomme (or stock,
Art. 1) and a glass of sherry. Boil gently half an hour, and serve.

43. =Terrapin Soup.= Take a live terrapin, and, removing the claws,
soak in boiling water for about three minutes. With a cloth remove
the shells, and, proceeding as for the green turtle, cut it in small
pieces and boil it in consomme (stock, Art. 1). When the terrapin is
cooked, add some Spanish sauce (Art. 80), with two glasses of sherry,
boil gently for twenty minutes, make some little balls prepared in the
manner described in green-turtle soup (Art. 41), and serve in your soup.

44. =Soup a la d'Orsay.= Wash the ends of a bunch of asparagus, which
boil with a little salt and a very little soda, drain them and put them
into cold water. Press them through a sieve, add two yolks of raw eggs
and three pints of consomme (stock), and, when boiling, a pinch of
sugar and an ounce of butter. Take the breasts of two roast pigeons,
then add to your soup when serving, and eight small eggs, which boil
soft (but sufficiently hard to remove the shells), and serve in your
soup.

45. =Soup aux Quenelles de Volaille.= Prepare some quenelles (see Art.
11) and serve them in three pints of consomme (Art. 1).

46. =Consomme Rachel.= Spread on a sheet of tin half a pound of farce
(Art. 11) of chicken (Art. 11) and put in the oven for three or four
minutes. Put it aside to cool, and then with a cutter for the purpose
form into round flat shapes. Place in a saucepan four ounces of flour,
which mix in three pints of cold consomme (Art. 1), boil gently for
half an hour, stirring with a spoon from time to time, so that it does
not stick to the saucepan. Strain, remove from the fire, and add three
yolks of eggs which you have mixed in a little water, a tablespoonful
of green peas previously boiled, the small rounds of chicken farce, and
serve.

47. =Rye Soup a l'Allemande.= Wash well half a pound of rye, and add
three pints of consomme (stock, Art. 1), a few pieces of celery, three
leeks, a little salt and pepper, and boil gently three hours. Remove
the leeks and celery, and cut in very thin slices as for Julienne soup.
Mix two ounces of flour in a little cold consomme, which pour into your
soup with your vegetables, taking care to stir well with a spoon. Add a
pinch of sugar, boil an hour, skim, and serve.

48. =Giblet Soup of Goose.= Take the giblets of a goose, which cut in
small pieces. Singe and remove the skin from the feet, and cut them in
small pieces, as also four ounces of larding pork. Put all together
in a saucepan, with one ounce of butter, and, when beginning to color
brown, add two ounces of flour, and boil for five minutes. Then add
three pints of consomme (stock), two green onions, a very little thyme,
a clove of garlic, two cloves, a bay-leaf, and a little mace, around
which put a few branches of parsley, and tie all together. Carefully
remove all grease from your soup, add a wineglass of sherry, and serve.

49. =Soup a la Bohemienne.= Cut a carrot in very small pieces, which
put in a saucepan with an ounce of butter. When beginning to color
lightly, add three pints of consomme (stock, Art. 1), boil for half an
hour, skim, add a pint of peas, a pinch of sugar, pepper, and nutmeg.
When your peas are cooked, make a paste with three ounces of flour, two
yolks of eggs, one whole egg, a glass of cream, and a little salt and
nutmeg. Put through a sieve into your soup, which must be boiling on
the fire, stir with a spoon, boil for ten minutes, add a tablespoonful
of chopped parsley, and serve.

50. =Soup with Poached Eggs a la Styrie.= Take three pints of consomme
(stock, Art. 1), which boil, and add thereto, by degrees, two ounces
of semolina, stirring constantly with a spoon. Poach in boiling water
with a little salt, and a tablespoonful of vinegar, six eggs, which put
into cold water. Blanch a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, which add
to your soup, with three quarters of a pint of green peas, and, lastly,
your poached eggs, which, just before serving in your soup, place in
hot water for an instant.

51. =English Hare Soup.= Cut a young hare in small pieces, which put in
a saucepan with four ounces of lard, cut in small squares, two ounces
of butter, and, when beginning to color brown, add one ounce of flour,
half a bottle of claret, and a quart of consomme (stock, Art. 1).
Season with a little thyme, a bay-leaf, two onions, a dozen mushrooms,
two cloves, a little salt, pepper, mace, and a very little cayenne.
Boil, and then remove your saucepan to the back of the range to simmer
gently. Take off all grease most carefully, and, when your hare is
thoroughly done, strain your consomme and serve with the hare.

52. =Soup of Sturgeon a la Pierre Legrand.= Take one pound of pike,
one of perch, and the same of eels, which put into a saucepan, with an
onion cut in slices, a carrot, a clove of garlic, a very little thyme,
and a bay-leaf. Cut up your fish, add four wineglasses of sherry, boil
until all moisture is absorbed, add three pints of consomme (stock,
Art. 1), boil for one hour, and press through a sieve. Take two pounds
of sturgeon, and boil gently with a carrot, an onion, a slice of ham,
salt, pepper, a small garlic, a pint of consomme, and a glass of
sherry. Make a farce of quenelles (see Art. 11), form in small balls,
which poach in hot water. Add them to the slices of sturgeon, also the
ends of a bunch of asparagus, previously boiled, and two tablespoonfuls
of chervil, chopped very fine. Strain the liquid in which your sturgeon
was boiled, add to the essence of fish prepared above, boil for a few
moments, and serve.

53. =Clam Chowder a la Thayer.= Put half a pound of fat salt pork in
a saucepan, let it fry slowly, and then remove it from the fire and
put it aside to cool. Chop up fine fifty large hard-clams, also half a
can of tomatoes, a handful of celery, the same of parsley, a quart of
onions, half a dozen pilot-biscuit, a little thyme, and two quarts of
potatoes cut up in pieces about as large as a five-cent piece. Put the
saucepan in which you have your pork again on the fire, add first the
onions, and then the other ingredients, with the juice of the clams,
and enough water to cover. Add black pepper, a little salt, and an
eighth of a pint of Worcestershire sauce. Stir from the bottom so as
to avoid burning, and simmer gently until the potatoes are thoroughly
done. When the chowder begins to boil, you may add boiling water if you
find it too thick. Five minutes before serving, add half a lemon sliced
thin.

54. =Olla Podrida= (Spanish Soup). Put in a saucepan two pounds of
beef, a pint of dwarf or chick peas, which you have previously soaked
in water for six hours. Then blanch in boiling water for twenty minutes
half a pound of bacon and half a pound of raw ham, which add to the
other ingredients, with enough water to cover them. Skim carefully,
and, after boiling gently two hours, add a fowl, a carrot, an onion, a
clove of garlic, two cloves, and two bay-leaves, which inclose in some
branches of parsley, tying all together. Boil again for an hour, adding

mixed in about a tablespoonful of water, and then your oysters. Put
this mixture on ice until cold, form it into balls about the size of
a small egg, and wrap up each one in a very thin piece of pork. Break
three eggs in a bowl, add six ounces of flour, and a little water, so
as to make a smooth and very soft paste, but sufficiently solid to

croquettes, which roll in bread-crumbs. Beat up three eggs, with which
cover your croquettes; again roll in bread-crumbs. Put some lard in a
frying-pan in which, when very hot, fry your croquettes, and, when a
bright yellow color, drain, and serve with fried parsley on top. You
may add to your mixture, before forming into croquettes, some chopped
truffles or chopped parsley.

284. =Puff Paste.= Put a pound of flour on a table, make a hole in
the center of the flour, in which by degrees pour half a pint of cold
water. The water should always be added in very small quantities at a
time, and thoroughly worked into the flour until perfectly absorbed
before adding more. When all the water has been thoroughly mixed
with the flour, work your paste out with the hands until round. Take
a pound of butter, which has been on the ice, and which you have
carefully washed. If very hard, knead it a little with your hands,
then place it in the middle of your paste, flatten it, fold your paste
over the butter so that it forms a square, and put it on the ice ten
minutes. Then with a rolling-pin roll out your paste (having previously
sprinkled the table with flour) about two feet long, then fold it one
third of its length, roll it once with the rolling-pin, then take the
remainder of the paste and fold it over the two other layers, and roll
the paste two or three times, fold the paste again as before, and put
it on the ice fifteen minutes. Then proceed as before, and put it again
on the ice. Repeat the same operation once again.

285. =Pate Brisee.= Put a pound of flour on a table, make a hollow in
the middle of the flour, in which put eight ounces of butter and not
quite half a pint of water. Work this paste well, so as to be quite
smooth.

286. =Bouchees de Salpicon.= Take half a pound of puff paste, and,
after having given it six turns, roll it out half an inch thick, cut
it out in ten rounds, with a muffin-ring or a mold for the purpose.
Mark lightly in the center of each, with the point of a knife, a very
small round. Brush them (with a camel's-hair brush) in beaten egg, put
them on a pan, send them to a very hot oven, and watch them carefully
so that they do not color too much on the outside before the inside is
done. This paste should rise at least two inches. When the bouchees
are thoroughly done inside, and colored bright yellow on the outside,
take them out of the oven, remove the small rounds in the center which
you have marked out, and also enough paste from the inside to make
space for the following mixture: Put half a pint of Spanish sauce (Art.
80), with a glass of sherry, in a saucepan on the fire, boil it ten
minutes, then add eight mushrooms, four chickens' livers, which you
have previously blanched in boiling water ten minutes, the breast of
a cold chicken, some cold smoked tongue, and two truffles, all cut in
small pieces. When hot, fill your bouchees, place the small covers on
top of each, and serve. Instead of Spanish sauce, Allemande sauce (Art.
81) is often preferred. You may also add four ounces of chicken farce
(Art. 11), which form into small balls, and poach in boiling water.
Instead of chicken, you may substitute sweetbreads; or you may fill the
bouchees with oysters, to which you have added an Allemande sauce and
some mushrooms cut in small pieces.

287. =Crouestades de Salpicon.= Take some pate brisee (Art. 285), roll
it out very thin, butter ten little tin molds, which line with your
paste, prick a few holes in the bottom and fill the insides, and send
them to a hot oven until done, take them out of the molds, brush the
outsides with beaten egg, put them back in the oven for five minutes,
remove the flour from the insides, using a small, dry brush, so that
none shall remain, and fill them with the mixture described in the
foregoing article.

288. =Cromesqui of Chicken.= Make a mixture as for chicken croquettes
(Art. 283), adding a little red pepper. When cold, form it into balls,
about the size of a small egg, and wrap up each one in a very thin
piece of pork. Break three eggs in a bowl, add six ounces of flour, mix
well together, and then add a little water, so as to make a smooth and
very soft paste, but sufficiently solid to adhere to your cromesqui.
Then mix thoroughly a teaspoonful of soda with your paste, with which
cover each cromesqui, and fry in very hot lard. When a bright yellow,
drain, and serve plain, or with a tomato sauce (Art. 90).

289. =Timbale of Chicken.= Chop fine, and then pound in a mortar half
a pound of the white meat of chicken, from which you have removed the
skin and sinews; add to the chicken, little by little, while pounding,
three sherry-glasses of _very_ cold cream, a little salt, white pepper,
and the whites of five eggs. When you have obtained a very fine, smooth
paste, press it through a sieve, and then fill with it ten little tin
molds, which you have buttered. Place them in a saucepan, in which you
have put the depth of an inch of water, cover your saucepan, and send
to the oven for about ten minutes, or until the mixture is firm enough
to turn out of the molds. Then serve with a sauce perigueux (Art. 91),
or a sauce supreme (Art. 99), or a sauce Allemande (Art. 81).

290. =Roast Turkey stuffed.= Clean and prepare a medium-sized turkey
for roasting. Cut two onions in pieces, and put them in a saucepan with
two ounces of lard, and color them lightly. Soak a pound of bread in
water, from which press the water, add the bread to your onions, with
the turkey's liver and heart chopped very fine, a little salt, two
pinches of pepper, the same of sage, a pinch of thyme, and mix all well
together. Stuff the inside of the turkey with this mixture, sew up the
opening through which you have introduced the stuffing, and put it to
roast, with a little butter on top, and a wineglass of water. Roast for
three quarters of an hour, strain the liquid in your pan, pour it over
your turkey, and serve.

291. =Turkey with Truffles.= Clean and prepare a young medium-sized
turkey as the foregoing. Melt four ounces of the fat of your turkey in
a frying pan with a shallot and a few truffles chopped fine, a pinch of
thyme, salt, pepper, and nutmeg, a pound of sausage-meat, and a can of
truffles cut in quarters. Mix all well together, and with this mixture
stuff your turkey; sew up the opening through which you have put your
farce. Roast the turkey for three quarters of an hour, putting a little
butter on the breast and a glass of white wine in the pan, and baste
it often. Serve your turkey on a dish, and pour over it the liquid
in your pan, which you have strained. Proceed in the same manner for
chickens, capons, partridges, etc.--the quantity of each ingredient in
proportion to the size of the piece roasted.

292. =Boned Turkey.= Take a hen-turkey of seven pounds, singe off the
hair, by passing it over some lighted alcohol, cut off the head and
neck, make an incision through the back its entire length, cut off the
wings, and remove all the bones of the turkey. Take three pounds of
chopped sausage-meat, the half of which place in the interior of your
turkey, cover the farce with alternate strips of larding pork, half an
inch wide, strips of cold ham, tongue, and some truffles cut in pieces
intermixed. Season with pepper. Place on top of these the other half of
your sausage-meat, which cover with another layer of larding pork, ham,
and truffles. Then draw the meat at the sides to the center of the back
of your turkey, and sew them together with a larding-needle threaded
with fine twine. Place on top several slices of lemon, from which you
have removed the peel and seeds, and wrap up your turkey very tight
in a cloth, which tie firmly with a string, and put in a saucepan,
in which you have put the bones of your turkey, a carrot, an onion,
a little thyme, two bay-leaves, two cloves, one clove of garlic, and
enough consomme (stock, Art. 1) to cover the turkey. Simmer gently for
three hours, then remove the cloth, which wash clean, and again wrap
the turkey in it, tying it as tight as possible. Place it in a pan,
put another pan on top, in which put a weight, so as to render the top
of the turkey perfectly flat, and put on ice for a day. Skim off the
grease from the liquid in which your turkey was cooked, strain, take
of it three pints, which put on the fire with three ounces of gelatine
and the juice of two lemons. Mix four whites of eggs with a glass of
water, pour into your saucepan with the stock and gelatine, stir all
well together, and when beginning to boil remove to the back of the
range to simmer gently for half an hour, strain through a flannel until
perfectly clear, add a wineglass of sherry, put on the ice until cold,
cut in pieces, which place on top and around your turkey.

293. =Tame Ducks roasted.= Clean and prepare two ducks for roasting.

Place your ducks on top, moisten them with sufficient consomme (Art.
1) to barely cover them, and a claret-glass of white wine. Boil very
gently for an hour. Pare some turnips, cut them round and small, in
sufficient quantity for eight people. Put them in a saucepan on the
fire, with an ounce of lard; when equally colored, drain them, and
place them in a saucepan with half a pint of Spanish sauce (Art. 80),
a pinch of sugar, a pinch of pepper; boil until the turnips are done.
Place your ducks on a dish, and your sauce, with the turnips, around
them.

296. =Ducks with Puree of Peas.= Clean, prepare, and cook two ducks as

them in some meat jelly (Art. 278) before it has quite stiffened. Then
pour into your mold some liquid jelly, about half an inch in depth;
add to your vegetables about half a pint of liquid jelly, and, when
beginning to stiffen, put them in your mold, which put on the ice for
an hour. Dip your mold in a little warm water, turn out your salad, and

becomes firm; remove it from the fire, and, when it has ceased boiling,
stir into it, as rapidly as possible, three eggs, one by one, then add
an ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, mixing it well with your other
ingredients. Lift out some of your mixture with a spoon, drop it on a
pan, forming it into small balls about the size of a nut, and brush
them with beaten egg. Cut an ounce of Gruyere cheese into as small
pieces as possible, sprinkle them on top of your balls, which send to a
gentle oven, and, when firm and well colored, serve.

517. =Cheese Straws.= Take half a pound of flour and make a hollow in
the center, in which put four ounces of butter, two ounces of Parmesan
cheese, an egg, a pinch of red pepper, and a gill of milk, which you

and serve very hot.

523. =Omelette Souffle.= Separate the yolks of twelve eggs from the
whites. Put the yolks of five in a deep dish, with half a pound of
sugar, a teaspoonful of extract of vanilla, and beat all together for
ten minutes with a wooden spoon. Put the whites of your eggs in a large
bowl, and with an egg-beater beat them very stiff, then mix them with
your yolks and sugar. Butter a dish, into which pour the above, send to
a moderate oven for about twelve minutes, sprinkle some sugar on top,
and serve instantly.

524. =Fried Bananas.= Cut eight bananas in two, through their length,
dip them in a paste composed of three eggs, six ounces of flour, well
mixed together, and a little water, so as to make a smooth, soft, and
rather liquid paste, but sufficiently solid to adhere to your bananas.
Add a teaspoonful of soda, and mix thoroughly with your paste, then
fry your bananas in hot lard, and, when colored a bright yellow, drain
them, sprinkle them with powdered sugar, and serve.

525. =Rice Croquettes.= Wash four ounces of rice in cold water, which
put in a saucepan on the fire, with a pint of water, and boil ten
minutes, then put in cold water for a moment. Put your rice back again
on the fire, with a pint of milk, a little grated orange and lemon
peel, and two ounces of sugar. Boil gently forty minutes. Let it
become perfectly cold, then form it into croquettes, beat up two eggs,
in which dip your croquettes. Roll them in bread-crumbs, fry them in
very hot lard, and, when your croquettes are a bright yellow, drain
them, sprinkle them with sugar, and serve. You may also serve them
with an apricot sauce made in the following manner: Put four ounces of
sugar and two wineglasses of water in a saucepan on the fire; when the
sugar is melted, add half a pound of apricots, boil for a moment, press
through a sieve, heat again on the fire, and serve. You may flavor with
vanilla, maraschino, kirsch, or any liqueur you wish.

526. =French Pancakes.= Put in a bowl six ounces of flour, with three
eggs, and a pinch of salt. Stir well together with a wooden spoon
until your paste is smooth, adding a gill of milk. Put a small piece
of butter in a frying-pan, and, when melted, put into it about two
tablespoonfuls of your paste; when colored on one side, turn it on the
other, and continue in the same manner until your paste is all used.
Put them on a dish, fill them with currant jelly, or jam, roll them
up, and powder them with sugar. Heat a poker or slender piece of iron
red hot, lay it lightly for a second on each pancake, making several
stripes across the pancake, and serve hot.

527. =Cabinet Pudding.= Soak in milk half a pound of baba (Art. 545),
brioche (Art. 594), or sponge cake (Art. 567). Remove the stems and the
seeds of two ounces of raisins, chop half an ounce of citron, blanch
and chop two ounces of almonds, and add six ounces of sugar. Mix all
together and place in a buttered mold. Stir ten eggs into half a pint
of milk, which pour into your mold. Put into a saucepan on the fire
some water, about two inches deep, place in it your mold, which cover,
and send to the oven for about an hour, or until firm enough to turn
out of the mold. Serve with the following sauce: Put in a saucepan on
the fire half a pint of milk, the yolks of six eggs, four ounces of
sugar, and a teaspoonful of extract of vanilla. Stir it well until it
begins to thicken. Pour it over your pudding, and serve.

528. =Bread Pudding.= Soak a pound of bread-crumbs in cold milk,
divide it in small pieces, so as not to form a solid lump, and add
three ounces of currants, and the same of raisins, from which you
have removed the seeds, the grated peel of an orange, an ounce of
citron cut in very small pieces, six ounces of powdered sugar, eight
well-beaten eggs, and half a pint of milk. Mix all well together.
Pour into a buttered mold, which place in a saucepan, which you have
filled with water the height of your mold. Boil about two hours, or
until thoroughly done, of which you may judge by slipping the point
of a knife in your pudding, and, if it comes out dry, the pudding
is sufficiently cooked. Turn it out of the mold, and serve with the
following sauce: Put a spoonful of corn starch in a saucepan on the
fire, mix with it half a glass of water, four ounces of sugar, and
the thin outside peel of a lemon, stir until boiling, then add three
wineglasses of sherry, brandy, or rum.

529. =English Plum-Pudding.= Remove the skin and the sinews from half
a pound of beef suet; chop it very fine, adding half a pound of flour,
and continue to chop until the flour is thoroughly mixed with the suet;
then add eight ounces of raisins from which you have removed the seeds,
and the same of currants, two ounces of citron cut in small pieces,
a little nutmeg, two apples which you have pared and chopped fine, a
wineglass of rum, and six eggs. Mix all well together, and then put
into a buttered mold, which place in a saucepan which you have filled
with water the height of your mold, and simmer gently six hours, then
turn your pudding out of the mold, and serve. Instead of boiling your
pudding in a mold, you may tie it securely in a buttered cloth, place
it in a saucepan with some boiling water, and boil it six hours; remove
the cloth, and serve with a sauce, with rum, of the preceding articles,
or sprinkle powdered sugar on top; pour some rum over the pudding,
light it, and serve burning.

530. =Pudding au Marasquin.= Take an ounce of raisins, from which you
have removed the seeds, and two ounces of currants; soak them in a
wineglass of sherry; then beat up slightly the yolks of six eggs, with
half a pound of powdered sugar; add your raisins and currants, a pint
of milk, half an ounce of gelatine, a teaspoonful of vanilla extract,
and put all together in a saucepan on the fire; stir until the gelatine
is dissolved, but do not allow your milk to boil; then strain. Put a
mold on ice, pour into it, about the depth of two inches, a part of
your mixture; when it has stiffened, cover entirely with Savoy cake an
inch thick and soaked in maraschino; then pour on top some more of your
mixture, about the depth of an inch high, and continue with alternate
layers of cake and your mixture until the mold is filled. Put it on the
ice until needed, then turn it out of the mold, and serve.

531. =Rice Pudding.= Wash well, rubbing it between the hands, half a
pound of rice; change the water several times. Boil it ten minutes in
boiling water; then put it in cold water for a moment, drain it, and
put it in a saucepan on the fire with three pints of milk, half a pound
of sugar, and the peel of a lemon cut extremely thin and grated; simmer
gently for an hour, take it off the fire, add four eggs, stirring until
well mixed, two ounces of raisins from which you have removed the
seeds, two ounces of currants, and half an ounce of citron cut in small
pieces. Butter a tin mold, sprinkle a few bread-crumbs on the bottom
and the sides, pour in your rice, and send it to a gentle oven for an
hour and a half; turn it out of your mold, and serve with the following
sauce: Put in a saucepan on the fire a tablespoonful of corn starch,
four yolks of eggs, half a pint of milk, four ounces of sugar, the
grated rind of an orange (or a teaspoonful of extract of vanilla); stir
until beginning to boil, strain, and serve.

532. =Rice Pudding= (another way). Wash six ounces of rice, changing
the water several times; boil it in boiling water for ten minutes, then
put it in cold water for a moment, drain it, and put it in a saucepan
on the fire with three pints of milk, six ounces of sugar, a little
grated lemon-peel, a pinch of allspice, and very little nutmeg. Simmer
gently for an hour, add, one by one, four eggs, and stir until well
mixed; pour your rice into a deep dish which you have buttered, send it
to the oven until well colored, then remove it from the oven, put it on
ice, and serve it extremely cold.

533. =Apple Charlotte.= Pare three dozen apples, put them in a saucepan
on the fire with half a glass of water and half of the peel of a lemon;
when your apples are soft, remove the lemon-peel, add six ounces of
sugar, four ounces of peach marmalade, and reduce one half, stirring
constantly, so that the apples do not stick to the saucepan. Butter a
tin mold, cut a piece of bread a quarter of an inch thick, the size and
shape of the bottom of your mold, dip it in melted butter, and place
it in your mold; then cut some pieces of bread, the same thickness as
above, the height of your mold and about two and a half inches wide.
Place them around the sides (having dipped them in melted butter), one
piece slightly overlapping the other. Pour the apples in the center,
cover with a piece of bread dipped in melted butter, and send to the
oven for about an hour; drain off the butter, turn your charlotte out
of the mold, and serve with the following sauce: Put in a saucepan half
a pound of peach marmalade with half a glass of water, two ounces of
sugar, and stir all well together until boiling, press through a sieve,
heat again on the fire, adding two liqueur-glasses of rum.

534. =Apples a la Conde.= Pare eight apples, in which cut a hole in the
center; put them in a saucepan on the fire with four ounces of sugar,
enough water to cover them, and half of the peel of a lemon. When the
apples are soft, remove the lemon-peel, drain them, and strain the
juice, which reduce on the fire two thirds. Boil half a pound of rice
(which you have previously washed) in boiling water ten minutes; then
put it in cold water for a moment, drain, and put it in a saucepan on
the fire with a pint and a half of milk, six ounces of sugar, and a
teaspoonful of extract of vanilla; boil gently three quarters of an
hour; put your rice, about an inch in depth, on a dish, arrange your
apples on top, fill the center with currant jelly, or any jam you wish;
pour over them the juice which you have reduced, decorate them with
blanched almonds cut in small pieces, citron, or angelica cut in small
pieces, and then put them on the ice, and, when very cold, serve.

535. =Compote of Apples.= Pare ten apples, in which cut a hole in the
center, put them in a saucepan with enough water to cover them, six
ounces of sugar, and the rind of a lemon; simmer very gently until
quite soft, without breaking; drain them, and reduce the juice three
quarters on the fire, strain, pour it over your apples, which you have
placed on a dish, and serve.

536. =Pommes Meringues.= Pare and cut in quarters two dozen apples,
removing the core and pips. Put them in a saucepan on the fire with
half a glass of water, six ounces of sugar, and the peel of an orange,
grated. Reduce one half, stirring constantly; then put them on the
ice; beat six whites of eggs very stiff, add to them four ounces of
sugar, stir them lightly together, cover your apples with the meringue,
sprinkle with powdered sugar, and send to a gentle oven until lightly
colored, then remove them, put them again on ice, and serve very cold.

537. =Beignets of Apples.= Pare, cut in round quarters, and remove the
core and pips of ten apples. Put half a pound of flour in a bowl, in
which break three eggs; mix them well with the flour, and add a little
water, so as to make rather a liquid paste, but sufficiently solid to
adhere to the apples, which dip into the paste, covering them entirely.
Put some lard in a frying-pan, in which, when very hot, fry your
apples. When a bright yellow, drain them, sprinkle them with sugar, and
serve hot. Beignets of peaches are prepared in the same manner.

538. =Beignets de Creme a la Vanille.= Put in a saucepan four eggs,
two ounces of corn starch, four ounces of sugar, and stir all well
together; add a pint of milk, a teaspoonful of vanilla, place on the
fire, stirring with a wooden spoon until boiling, and pour into a pan
which you have buttered. Let it become cold, then cut it into pieces
an inch wide and three inches long. Make a paste as for the foregoing
article, in which dip your mixture (which you have cut in pieces),
and fry in very hot lard. When colored a bright yellow, drain them,
sprinkle them with sugar, and serve.

539. =Beignets Souffles.= Make a paste as for eclairs (Art. 547),
adding a teaspoonful of extract of vanilla. Put some lard in a
frying-pan, which, when melted, should be about two and a half inches
high in your pan, and, when very hot, take with a spoon some pieces of
your paste about the size of a nut, drop them in your lard, and fry
them a bright yellow; drain them, roll them in powdered sugar, and
serve.

540. =Almond Puddings.= Blanch and chop fine a quarter of a pound of
almonds, which mix thoroughly together with two ounces of flour, four
ounces of powdered sugar, and two ounces of corn starch. Separate the
whites and yolks of eight eggs. Beat the yolks well, flavor them with
vanilla, and mix together with the above ingredients. Then beat the
whites very stiff, and stir them in thoroughly with the rest. Butter
some little tin timbale-molds, which nearly fill with the mixture,
cover with buttered paper, and place them in a pan in which you have
put enough water to reach about three quarters of the height of the
timbale-molds, and send to a moderate oven for about three quarters of
an hour, or until done, of which you may judge by inserting a straw in
the cake, and, if it comes out clean, it is sufficiently done. Remove
the cake from the molds. Serve with the following sauce: With a small
coffee-cup full of currant jelly, to which add about the same quantity
of claret, add a little sugar, a very little stick cinnamon, and a
little nutmeg. Strain, and serve hot. OBS.--This pudding, instead of
the almonds, may be made with macaroons (about twelve), which should
be well browned in the oven, and then crushed fine with a rolling-pin,
and mixed with the flour, etc., in the same order as described for the
almonds.

541. =Baked Custard.= Break eight eggs in a bowl, to which add half a
pound of sugar, a quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls of vanilla, and a
sherry-glass of brandy. Mix all well together, strain, put in a deep
dish, and send to a gentle oven for about forty minutes, or until well
colored on top. Serve very cold.

542. =Boiled Custard.= Put in a saucepan twelve eggs, to which mix
gradually a pint and a half of milk; add half a pound of sugar, a
tablespoonful of vanilla, and a sherry-glass of rum. Put on the fire,
stirring with an egg-beater until beginning to thicken, then remove the
custard from the fire, not having allowed it to boil. Strain, and stir
until nearly cold. Serve very cold.

543. =Trifles.= Soak some sponge cake in sherry, put it on a dish,
place a layer of raspberry jam on top, which cover entirely with
whipped cream, to which add some powdered sugar, and flavor with
vanilla.

544. =Brioche.= Take a quarter of a pound of flour, make a hollow in
the center, in which put half of a cake of yeast, and moisten with a
little tepid water (about two ounces) until the paste is soft, then put
it in a saucepan, and leave it in rather a warm place. Then put three
quarters of a pound of flour on a table, make a hollow in the center
of the flour, in which put a pinch of sugar, seven eggs, one by one,
mixing each thoroughly with the flour before adding another, and three
quarters of a pound of butter, little by little, mixing it thoroughly
with the flour and eggs. Then see if your yeast has risen twice its
height; and if so, add it to your paste, which put in a warm place
eight hours; after which sprinkle a little flour on a table, form your
paste into balls of about two ounces each, brush them over with beaten
egg, send them to a hot oven, and, when well colored, remove from the
oven.

545. =Pate a Brioche Panachee.= Take half the quantity of the foregoing
paste, roll it out half an inch thick, on top of which place a layer
of peach marmalade, and send to the oven for about ten minutes; then
sprinkle on top of the marmalade an ounce of currants, previously
washed and dried, about twenty blanched almonds cut in small pieces,
and a little citron, also cut in small pieces. Then divide your brioche
in pieces three inches long and an inch wide. Serve cold.

546. =Baba.= Put four ounces of flour on a table, make a hollow in the
center, in which put half a cake of yeast, and moisten with a little
milk, so as to form a soft paste, which put in a saucepan, and leave in
a warm place. Then put six ounces of flour on a table, make a hollow
in the center, in which put ten ounces of flour, two ounces of sugar,
six ounces of butter, and three eggs. Mix all well together, working
it with the hands, and adding, one by one, three eggs and a wineglass
of rum. Then mix together an ounce of currants, with three ounces of
raisins, from which you have removed the seeds, and half an ounce of
citron, cut in small pieces, and add them to your paste, also the rest
of your paste, with the yeast. Fill a buttered mold a third of its
height with your paste, and send to a moderate oven for about three
quarters of an hour. Pass the point of a knife into the baba, and if
sufficiently done it will come out dry. Then turn it out of your mold,
pour over it two liqueur-glasses of rum, sprinkle a little sugar on
top, and serve. Instead of putting the baba in a large mold, you may
put it in several very small ones if preferred.

547. =Eclairs.= Put an ounce of butter in a saucepan on the fire, with
about six tablespoonfuls of water. When beginning to boil, add about
two and a half ounces of flour, stirring with a wooden spoon about five
minutes, then remove from the fire, and add, one by one, four eggs,
stirring rapidly, until each is well mixed. Then put your mixture in
a cornucopia of stiff paper, with a hole in the point, through which
press it on a pan, forming little shapes similar to lady fingers. Send
them to a gentle oven for about twenty minutes, or until firm; let them
become cold, then make an incision in them, the length of each, through
the middle, in which place some whipped cream, to which you have added
sugar and a little essence of coffee. Then put in a copper saucepan, or
one which is well enameled and thoroughly clean, half a pound of sugar,
with a glass of water. After remaining on the fire a few moments, lift
out a little of the sugar with a wooden spoon, and drop it in a cup of
cold water. Take the sugar between the thumb and third finger, separate
them, and, if you may draw the sugar out in a fine thread without
breaking, you have reached the desired result. Put it in a bowl, and
add a tablespoonful of the extract of coffee, stir until beginning to
thicken, cover with it the top of each eclair, and, when cold, serve.

548. =Chocolate Eclairs.= Make a paste as for the foregoing, which form
into eclairs, and bake as the above. Put in a saucepan two eggs, two
tablespoonfuls of corn starch, two ounces of sugar, a glass of milk, a
teaspoonful of vanilla, and stir all together on the fire. Just before
beginning to boil, remove from the fire and let it become cold. Then
fill the inside of your eclairs with your cream. Melt an ounce of
chocolate in a tablespoonful of water, boil half a pound of sugar as
the foregoing, mix thoroughly with your chocolate, with which cover
your eclairs.

549. =Duchess Cakes with Peach Marmalade.= Make a paste as for eclairs
(Art. 547), of which take about half a tablespoonful at a time, and
place on a pan in oval form, as for meringues, only smaller, and about
three inches apart. Brush them with beaten egg, send them to a gentle
oven, and, when they are done, make an incision in each one through
the middle, and fill the inside with peach marmalade, or any other
preferred. Then put in a copper saucepan, or one which is well enameled
and thoroughly clean, half a pound of sugar, with a glass of water.
After remaining on the fire a few moments, lift out a little of the
sugar with a wooden spoon, and drop it in a cup of cold water. Take
the sugar between the thumb and third finger, separate them, and, if
you may draw the sugar out in a fine thread without breaking, you have
reached the desired result. Then cover the top of each cake with the
sugar, and, when cold, serve.

550. =Gateau St. Honore.= Take some pate brisee (Art. 285), roll it out
thin, and with it line a round tin pie-dish, which you have buttered.
Then take some paste, as for eclairs (Art. 547), and form a border of
about an inch thick on top of your other paste in the pan, brush it
over with beaten eggs, and send it to a moderate oven until thoroughly
done, then remove it. Make a cornucopia of stiff paper, with a hole cut
in the end, fill it with eclair paste, press it out through the hole
on a pan, forming the paste into about a dozen and a half small balls
the size of a French chestnut, prick a hole in the bottom of each, and
send them to the oven until done. When cold, dip them in melted sugar,
as described in the foregoing article, place them all around the top of
your paste in the pie-dish. Whip a pint of cream, let it remain fifteen
minutes on the ice, drain off all the moisture, mix well with your
cream three ounces of sugar and half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and fill
the inside of your pastry. You may, instead of vanilla, flavor your
cream with rum, chocolate, or raspberry, and decorate the pastry with
candied oranges, cherries, and other candied fruits.

551. =Apple Tart.= Peel two dozen apples, which put in a saucepan with
two tablespoonfuls of water and a little grated lemon-peel; stew them
until soft, then add three ounces of sugar, and stir with a wooden
spoon five minutes; then let them become cold. Take some pate brisee
(Art. 285), roll it out thin, and with it line a pie-dish large enough
to contain your apples, which place in the dish. Roll out some more
paste very thin, sprinkle it with flour, double it, cut it in strips a
quarter of an inch wide, moisten the edges of your tart, and place the
strips on top of your apples, a small space between each, fasten the
ends to the edge of your dish, and brush the strips lightly with water;
place an equal quantity of strips across and on top of the others,
making a sort of lattice-work; brush them over with beaten egg, and
send the tart to a hot oven; when three quarters done, remove it, brush
it over with a little melted currant jelly; return it to the oven until
thoroughly done both underneath and on top.

552. =Apple Tart a la Portugaise.= Line a pie-dish with some pate
brisee (Art. 285), then place on top a layer, about half an inch thick,
of peach marmalade, and send to the oven until the paste is done. Peel
eight apples, cut them in two, remove the core and the pips, put them
in a saucepan with a pint of water, six ounces of sugar, and the rind
of a lemon; stew them until soft, without breaking; then drain them and
place them on top of the peach marmalade in your tart, strain the juice
of your apples, reduce it two thirds on the fire, and, just before
serving, pour it over your tart.

553. =Apricot Tart.= Line a pie-dish with some pate brisee (Art. 285)
rolled thin, sprinkle the bottom with powdered sugar, fill the dish
with canned apricots, send it to a hot oven, and, when thoroughly done,
sprinkle the top with powdered sugar, and serve. Proceed in the same
manner for tart of peaches, and currants (to which add more sugar), and
cherries (first removing the stones).

554. =Gateau d'Artois.= Peel a dozen apples, remove the core and pips,
and stew them with a tablespoonful of water in a saucepan. When soft,
add two ounces of sugar and a little cinnamon, and stew ten minutes
longer. Take some puff paste (Art. 284), roll it out thin, divide it
in two equal parts, spread your apples on one part, covering them with
the other; moisten the edges of your paste, which fasten together by
pressing upon the top layer with the thumb. Then mark out lightly, with
a knife, ten equal pieces, about four inches long and an inch and a
half wide. Brush the top with beaten egg, and send to a hot oven until
well colored and thoroughly done underneath. Cut the pieces through,
which you have marked out, and serve.

555. =Mince Pie.= Chop very fine half a pound of beef suet, three
quarters of a pound of cold beef, three apples which you have peeled,
two ounces of citron, and a little lemon-peel; add a pound of powdered
sugar, half a pound of currants, the same of raisins, a teaspoonful of
ginger, the same of nutmeg, half a pint of sherry, and a quarter of a
pint of brandy. Mix all well together in a jar, which cover, and let
it remain for eight days. Take some puff paste (Art. 284), roll it out
thin, and with it line a flat pie-dish, into which place your mince
meat, and cover with another layer of paste, which moisten and press
all around the edge so as to fasten it securely. Brush the top with
beaten egg, and send to a moderate oven for about forty minutes, and,
if sufficiently done, serve very hot.

556. =Pastries a la Conde.= Put four ounces of almonds in boiling
water, remove the skins, wash the almonds, dry them, and chop them
fine. Mix with them thoroughly two ounces of powdered sugar and half
the white of an egg; roll out some puff paste (Art. 284) half an inch
thick, five inches wide, and fourteen inches long. Spread the almonds
entirely over your paste, sprinkle lightly with sugar, and cut the
paste in ten equal strips across the length. Send them to rather a hot
oven, and, when well colored, serve.

557. =Gateau Fourre aux Amandes.= Put four ounces of almonds in boiling
water, and remove the skins. Pound the almonds to a paste, with which
mix thoroughly four ounces of sugar, an ounce of butter, the yolks of
two eggs, and half a sherry-glass of rum. Take half a pound of puff
paste (Art. 284), roll it a quarter of an inch thick, and, with a
sufficient quantity, line a shallow pie-dish. Moisten the edge of your
paste, fill the pie-dish with your mixture of almonds, make a border
with the rest of your paste around the edge of your dish, then, with
the point of a knife, trace some fanciful design on the top, brush it
over with beaten egg, send to a hot oven for about forty-five minutes,
and, if well done underneath, sprinkle some powdered sugar on top, and,
when melted, remove from the oven and serve. You may also serve this
cold.

558. =Gateau Fourre aux Pommes.= Peel and cut in quarters a dozen
apples, from which remove the core and pips. Put them in a saucepan on
the fire with a sherry-glass of water, the peel of half a lemon, and
four ounces of sugar. Stew them for about seven or eight minutes, stir
them for a few moments with a wooden spoon, let them become cold, and
finish as described in the preceding article.

559. =Gateau Fourre a la Creme.= Mix thoroughly together in a saucepan
two ounces of flour with two eggs, add a glass of milk, stirring well,
so as to make a smooth paste, then a glass of cream and half an ounce
of butter. Continue to stir with a wooden spoon until boiling, then let
it simmer gently at the side of the range for fifteen minutes, stirring
it from time to time. Let it become cold, and add to it three ounces
of sugar, two pounded macaroons, a teaspoonful of vanilla, and mix
all well together. Take some puff paste (Art. 284), and finish as for
gateau fourre aux amandes (Art. 557).

560. =Mars.= Take some brioche paste (Art. 544), roll it out a quarter
of an inch thick, six inches wide, and sixteen inches long. Cover it
with apple marmalade, and send it to a very gentle oven for about ten
minutes. Then let it become cold, and cut it into strips an inch wide,
across the length of the paste. Beat six whites of eggs very stiff,
mix with them half a pound of powdered sugar, with which cover each
strip of pastry on top, about three quarters of an inch thick. Blanch
twenty almonds, cut them in long, thin strips, place them two by two
on top of your pastries, the two points meeting in the center (six or
eight pieces of almonds on each will be sufficient), sprinkle them with
powdered sugar, and send them to the oven about twelve minutes, or
until colored lightly.

561. =Fanchonettes.= Roll out thin some pate brisee (Art. 285), with
which line some little molds. Fill them two thirds with apple, peach,
or any other marmalade preferred, and send them to a hot oven twelve
minutes. Then let them become cold. Beat six whites of eggs very stiff,
and mix well with them half a pound of powdered sugar; cover your
little tarts with it half an inch thick, and smooth it on top with the
blade of a knife. Make a cornucopia of stiff paper, cut a hole in the
end of it, put in it some of the white of egg and sugar, and press it
through the hole, forming on top of each tart, in a circle, six very
small balls, and one in the center. Sprinkle over them some powdered
sugar, and send them to a very gentle oven. They should not be allowed
to color. When they are firm, remove them from the oven, place on top
of each little ball a very small piece of currant jelly, and serve.

562. =Cream Pastries with Almonds.= Take some puff paste (Art. 284),
roll it out very thin, and cut it in ten pieces, each about three
inches wide and four inches long. Send them to the oven, and, when
done, take them out; then cut ten other pieces of the same size as the
above, and brush them with beaten egg; blanch two ounces of almonds,
chop them fine, mix with them a very little powdered sugar, a _very_
little white of egg, and sprinkle them on top of your ten pieces of
paste, which send to the oven until well colored, and let them become
cold. Beat up half a pint of cream, put it on the ice about fifteen
minutes, drain it on a sieve, mix with it, in a bowl, an ounce of sugar
and a little extract of vanilla. Place your cream on the plain pieces
of pastry, and cover with those on which you have sprinkled the almonds.

563. =Gateau Madeleine a l'Orange.= Put in a bowl half a pound of
powdered sugar, the same of flour, four eggs, the grated peel of an
orange, and mix all well together. Put half a pound of butter near the
fire, so as to make it soft without melting it quite liquid, and add
it to your other ingredients. Butter ten little tin molds, which fill
three quarters with your mixture, and send them to a gentle oven for
about twenty minutes, or until thoroughly done, of which you may judge
by passing the point of a knife through one, and, if it comes out dry,
your cake is sufficiently baked. Instead of the orange-peel, you may
flavor, if you wish, with vanilla, adding some currants and citron cut
in very small pieces.

564. =Gateau Genoise.= Put in a bowl half a pound of sugar with half
a pound of butter, heated, so as to be a little soft. Beat up both
together quickly with a wooden spoon for three or four minutes, then
add three eggs, one by one, mixing each thoroughly before adding
another. Then add the yolks of three eggs, the grated peel of half a
lemon; stir all well together, adding half a pound of flour; beat the
three whites of your eggs, and add them to the foregoing. Butter a pan,
into which pour your mixture about three quarters of an inch thick;
send it to a gentle oven for about thirty minutes, cut it in small
pieces, and ice it as for coffee eclairs (Art. 547).

565. =Gateau Savarin.= Put three ounces of flour in a bowl, with half
a cake of yeast, adding about two sherry-glasses of lukewarm milk,
so as to form a soft paste, to which, when risen double its height,
add twelve ounces of flour, seven ounces of butter (a little warm), a
pinch of salt, an ounce of sugar, and seven eggs. Beat up your mixture
well with a wooden spoon, and, while beating, add, one by one, four
eggs. When the mixture no longer sticks to the bowl, you have beaten
it enough; then add to it half an ounce of citron cut in very small
pieces, and put it in rather a warm place for about two hours. Butter a
tin mold, which sprinkle with a few chopped almonds, fill the mold one
half with your mixture, and let it rise half as much again; then send
to a moderate oven, slip the point of a knife into the cake, and, if it
comes out dry, it is sufficiently done. Turn it out of your mold; put
four ounces of sugar, with a glass of water, in a saucepan on the fire,
boil five minutes, add a tablespoonful of anisette, two tablespoonfuls
of rum, and one of curacoa, which pour gradually over your cake until
absorbed, and serve.

566. =Manquet.= Put the yolks of eight eggs in a bowl with half a pound
of sugar, and stir with a wooden spoon three or four minutes; then add
the grated peel of a lemon. Whip the three whites of your eggs until
very stiff, add them gradually to the above ingredients, also an ounce
of melted butter, and stir all together lightly. Butter a tin mold,
dust it with flour, pour into it your mixture, and send it to a gentle
oven for about half an hour. Slip the point of a knife into your cake,
and, if it comes out dry, it is sufficiently done.

567. =Sponge Cake.= Put in a bowl a pound of flour, three quarters of a
pound of powdered sugar, two eggs, two glasses of milk, and the grated
rind of a lemon. Mix all well together, and then add six ounces of
melted butter, and a teaspoonful of Royal Baking Powder. Butter a tin
mold, in which pour your mixture; send it to a gentle oven, and, when
sufficiently colored, slip the point of a knife into it, and, if it
comes out dry, your cake is done. Turn it out of the mold, and serve.

568. =Lady Fingers.= Put four ounces of powdered sugar in a bowl, with
the yolks of four eggs, and stir them well together with a wooden
spoon, until they become white and slightly consistent; then add three
ounces of flour and a little grated lemon-peel. Beat up the whites of
your eggs until very stiff, then mix them lightly, in small quantities
at a time, with your other ingredients. Pour your mixture into a
cornucopia made of stiff paper, with a hole in the end, through which
press it on a pan (on which you have spread a sheet of white paper),
forming it into lady fingers, about five inches long and not quite an
inch wide, sprinkle each with powdered sugar, and send them to a very
gentle oven, watching them, so that they do not color too much. When
they are firm, slip the blade of a knife underneath them, so as to
remove them from the pan, and serve.

569. =Savoy Cake.= Put the yolks of three eggs in a bowl, with four
ounces of powdered sugar, beat them well until slightly consistent, and
add to them an ounce and a half of flour, an ounce of corn starch, a
few drops of extract of vanilla, and mix all well together. Beat up the
whites of your eggs very stiff, and stir them lightly with your other
ingredients. Butter a mold, which sprinkle with sugar, and into which
pour your mixture. Send it to a gentle oven, and, when it is done (of
which you may judge by slipping the point of a knife into it, and, if
it comes out dry, your cake is sufficiently baked), turn it out of the
mold, let it become cold, and serve.

570. =Macaroons.= Put half a pound of almonds in boiling water, remove
the skins, then put the almonds in cold water, which drain off, and put
them in the oven to dry. Pound them to a paste, adding, by degrees, the
white of an egg; then add a pound and a half of powdered sugar, again
pound well, adding, little by little, the whites of two eggs. Spread
on a pan a sheet of white paper, form your mixture in little rounds,
somewhat smaller than a twenty-five cent piece, place them on top of
the paper in your pan, each about an inch and a half apart from the
other. Send them to a gentle oven for about twelve minutes, the door of
the oven shut, and, at the end of that time, if they are well colored,
remove them from the oven, let them become cold, turn the paper upside
down, moisten it with a little water underneath, and remove the
macaroons.

571. =Tea Cakes.= Put on a table a pound of flour, which you have
previously sifted, make a hole in the middle, in which place half a
pound of butter, six ounces of powdered sugar, a pinch of ginger, and
four eggs. Mix all well together, and roll out your paste extremely
thin, cut it out in rounds or squares, which put on a pan, which you
have buttered lightly, brush your cakes with beaten egg, sprinkle them
on top with half a pound of currants. Send them to the oven, and, when
colored a bright yellow, remove them, and serve when needed.

572. =Chocolate Cakes.= Make the same mixture as for Savoy cake (Art.
569), put it in a cornucopia made of stiff paper, with a hole in the
end, through which press it on a pan (on which you have spread a sheet
of white paper), and form it into small rounds about the size of a
fifty-cent piece. Send them to a gentle oven until they are quite firm,
then let them become cold, and cut them all the same size with a small
round cutter. Spread a layer of peach or other marmalade on the half of
your cakes, which cover with the other half. Melt about two ounces of
chocolate in about two tablespoonfuls of water. Put in a saucepan on
the fire half a pound of sugar, with half a glass of water, boil for
about eight to ten minutes, lift out some of the sugar with a spoon,
drop it into cold water, place it between the thumb and third finger,
and, if you may draw the sugar out into a long fine thread without
breaking, you have reached the desired result. Then put your chocolate
in a bowl, add your sugar, stirring until beginning to thicken. Take as
many little wooden skewers as you have cakes, sharpen them to a fine
point, stick one into each cake, which dip into your chocolate and
sugar, covering it entirely. Put a colander upside down on a table, and
in the holes place the ends of your sticks, thereby allowing the cakes
on the opposite end to dry, after which remove your cakes from the
sticks, and serve when needed.

573. =Angel Cake.= Beat the whites of eleven eggs very stiff. Mix with
half a pound of sifted flour, half a pound of sugar, and a teaspoonful
of cream of tartar. Flavor with extract of almond or extract of
pineapple. Then mix all together with the whites of eggs, and bake in
a moderate oven for about forty minutes, or until thoroughly done, of
which you may judge by passing the point of a knife into your cake,
and, if it comes out dry, it is sufficiently done. Do not butter the
pan for this cake.

574. =Pound Cake.= Put in a bowl half a pound of butter, which you have
put in rather a warm place, so as to be a little soft. Add two eggs,
which beat well together with the butter for four or five minutes. Add
another egg, which also beat five minutes, and then another, and beat
all together the same length of time, and mix with the foregoing half a
pound of flour, four ounces of currants, and the same of raisins, which
you have stoned. Butter a mold, put a piece of paper in the bottom, and
also around the sides, pour your mixture into the mold, and send it to
a moderate oven for about an hour. Pass the point of a knife into your
cake, and, if it comes out dry, it is sufficiently done.

575. =Charlotte-Russe.= Butter a tin mold, the bottom and sides of
which line with lady fingers. Whip a pint of cream until quite firm,
and put it on the ice. Dissolve half an ounce of gelatine in about
a sherry-glass of hot water, then add four ounces of sugar. Boil a
sherry-glass of milk, remove it from the fire, and mix with it four
eggs, stirring rapidly. Strain your gelatine and sugar, and add them,
with a teaspoonful of vanilla, to your other ingredients, and mix all
well together. When beginning to stiffen, add your whipped cream, which
remove from the bowl with a skimmer, so as to drain off all moisture.
Fill your mold with the cream, put it on ice for an hour, take it out
of the mold, and serve.

576. =Bavarian Strawberry Cream.= Dissolve a quarter of an ounce of
gelatine in three or four tablespoonfuls of hot water, then add to it
four ounces of powdered sugar, and put it through a sieve. Whip a pint
of cream, and, when firm, put it on ice for a quarter of an hour. Press
four ounces of strawberries through a sieve, which put in a bowl with
your gelatine and sugar. When beginning to stiffen slightly, add your
whipped cream, which remove from the bowl with a skimmer, so as to
drain off all moisture. Mix all well together, and pour into a mold,
which put on ice for about an hour. Then turn your cream out of the
mold, and serve.

577. =Bavarian Chocolate Cream.= Prepare exactly as for the foregoing,
adding two ounces of chocolate which you have previously melted.

578. =Bavarian Vanilla Cream.= Proceed as for Bavarian strawberry cream
(Art. 576), except that instead of adding strawberries, flavor with a
teaspoonful of vanilla.

579. =Bavarian Coffee Cream.= Proceed as for Bavarian strawberry cream
(Art. 576), but, instead of strawberries, flavor with a tablespoonful
of essence of coffee.

580. =Jelly of Rum.= Dissolve two ounces of gelatine in a pint and a
half of very hot water on the fire, and, when melted, add ten ounces
of sugar. Beat three whites of eggs with half a glass of water, which
mix with your gelatine, stirring quickly with an egg-beater. Then put
all on the fire until boiling, then remove to the back of the range to
simmer gently for half an hour. Strain your jelly through a flannel
until perfectly clear, and add three sherry-glasses of rum. Pour it
into a mold, which put on the ice until sufficiently stiff to turn out.

581. =Wine Jelly.= Proceed as for the foregoing, adding a pint and
a quarter of water (instead of a pint and a half), the juice of a
lemon, a very small piece of cinnamon stick, a gill of sherry, and a
sherry-glass of brandy. Finish as the preceding.

582. =Meringues.= Beat the whites of eight eggs as stiff as possible,
then mix with them lightly three quarters of a pound of sugar; but
do not beat them after adding the sugar. Fill a tablespoon with your
beaten eggs, which place in oval form on a board slightly moistened
and covered with a sheet of white paper; continue until your eggs are
all used, and place each spoonful about an inch apart from the other.
Send to a very gentle oven, with the door shut, for about ten minutes,
and, if sufficiently firm, remove them, turn them over on a pan, which
put in a _very_ gentle oven for about three quarters of an hour; take
them out, press them in the middle with your thumb, so as to render
them hollow, and, when cold, fill them with whipped cream to which you
have added two ounces of sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla. When the
weather is very hot, and it is sometimes difficult to whip cream, put
it in a bowl, which place in a larger one, and surround the smaller
with cracked ice, mixed with a little rock salt.

583. =Jelly of Mixed Fruits.= Dissolve on the fire two ounces of
gelatine in three or four tablespoonfuls of water, add ten ounces of
sugar, and, when melted, remove from the fire. Mix the whites of three
eggs in half a glass of water, add to your gelatine, stirring quickly
with an egg-beater. Then put all on the fire until boiling, then remove
to the back of the range to simmer gently for half an hour. Strain
your jelly through a flannel until perfectly clear; pour a little of
it into a mold, and, when the jelly is sufficiently stiff, place on
top of it two dozen very red cherries from which you have removed the
stones, an ounce of white currants, the same of red, two ounces of
pineapple, and the same of raspberries, or strawberries if in season.
Pour the rest of your jelly into the mold, which put on the ice until
sufficiently stiff to turn out of the mold.

584. =French Chestnuts with Coffee Sauce.= Remove the shells from three
dozen French chestnuts, boil the chestnuts five minutes in water, then
peel off the skin which covers them, put them in a saucepan on the
fire, with enough water to cover them, and two ounces of sugar; boil
them until soft, without breaking, and drain them. Put in a saucepan
on the fire four yolks of eggs, three ounces of sugar, a teacupful
of black coffee, and half a glass of cream. Stir until just before
boiling, then strain it, allow it to become cold, pour it over your
marrons, and serve.

585. =Nougat.= Put half a pound of almonds in boiling water for two or
three minutes, remove the skins, wash the almonds, and cut them each in
seven or eight long strips, then put them in the oven to dry. Put in a
copper or well-enameled saucepan, on the fire, five ounces of powdered
sugar, which be careful to stir very gently until colored brown, then
add your almonds, which should be slightly browned and very hot. Mix
all together, rub a little oil lightly over a pan, into which pour your
nougat, cut it immediately into pieces about four inches long and an
inch and a half wide, and let them become cold.

586. =Vanilla Ice Cream.= Put in a saucepan on the fire a quart
of milk, three quarters of a pound of sugar, three tablespoonfuls
of extract of vanilla, and eight yolks of eggs. Stir well with an
egg-beater, and, when beginning to thicken without boiling, strain your
mixture and allow it to become cold. Place the tin freezer into the
pail belonging to it, surround it with chopped ice mixed with about
half a pound of rock salt, pour your cream into the tin can, which
cover, and then turn the handle at the side of the pail rapidly around
for a few moments, take off the cover from the can, and with a spoon
detach any of the cream which may have frozen to the sides. Again put
on the cover, continue to turn the handle, repeating from time to time
the operation just described, and pressing the cream down with the
spoon, so as to make it smooth. When the cream is thoroughly frozen,
put it into a mold, place a piece of thick paper on top, over which
shut down the cover securely. Place your mold in a bowl, surround it
with chopped ice, with which mix two handfuls of rock salt. Just before
serving, turn your ice cream out of the mold by dipping it for a few
seconds in warm water. Instead of extract of vanilla, the vanilla-bean
will give a much better flavor.

587. =Coffee Ice Cream.= Put in a saucepan on the fire a pint and a
half of milk, the yolks of eight eggs, fourteen ounces of sugar, and
half a pint of very strong black coffee. Stir well with an egg-beater,
and, when beginning to thicken without boiling, strain your mixture,
allow it to become cold, and freeze as the foregoing.

588. =Chocolate Ice Cream.= Prepare a mixture as for vanilla ice cream
(Art. 586). Melt four ounces of chocolate in half a glass of water, on
the fire, add it to your mixture, strain it through a sieve, and freeze
as described in Art. 586.

589. =Strawberry Ice Cream.= Press through a sieve a sufficient
quantity of strawberries to obtain half a pint of juice, which put into
a tin freezing-can with three quarters of a pound of sugar and a quart
of cream, and freeze as vanilla ice cream (Art. 586).

590. =Strawberry Mousse.= Proceed as for strawberry ice cream, and,
when half frozen, stir into it quickly a pint of whipped cream, put it
in a mold for two hours, surrounded by cracked ice and a little rock
salt, then turn it out, and serve. Whipped cream may be added to all
kinds of plain ice creams.

591. =Neapolitan Ice Cream.= Prepare a mixture as for vanilla ice cream
(Art. 586). Let it become cold, put it in the freezer, and, when not
quite frozen, take out one third of it, stirring into it rapidly about
an ounce and a half of chocolate, which you have previously melted. Put
it into a mold, which place in a large bowl, and surround the mold with
cracked ice, and about two handfuls of rock salt. When the ice cream is
sufficiently stiff to support another layer on top, take out the half
of that which is in the freezer, place it in your mold on top of the
chocolate ice cream. Then mix with the remaining portion of ice cream
not quite a gill of strawberry juice, and place in your mold, which
leave two hours in the ice, turn the ice cream out, and serve.

592. =Nesselrode Pudding.= Remove the shells from two dozen French
chestnuts, which put in a saucepan, with a little water, then peel off
the skin which covers them, and put the chestnuts in a saucepan on
the fire, with a pint of water and a pound of sugar. Boil them until
very soft, then press them through a sieve, and put them again in a
saucepan with a pint of cream, in which you mixed the yolks of four
eggs. Just before beginning to boil, put your mixture through a sieve,
add an ounce of raisins, which you have stoned, an ounce of currants,
two sherry-glasses of yellow chartreuse, and freeze it, as described
in Art. 586. When frozen, cut four candied apricots, also four candied
green gages, and half an ounce of citron all in small pieces, add
three ounces of candied cherries; mix them thoroughly in your ice
cream, which put in a mold, a thick piece of paper on top, and the
cover securely shut down upon it. Put some cracked ice, mixed with two
handfuls of rock salt, in a bowl, in the middle of which place your
mold, covering it entirely with the ice and salt, where let it remain
two hours, then turn the ice cream out of the mold, first dipping it
for a few seconds in warm water.

593. =Frozen Apple Pudding a la Marie Heloise.= Cut four ounces of
almonds, and the same of citron, into long thin strips, and boil them
in a thick sugar sirup, with four ounces of large raisins, and the
same of candied cherries; when boiled, let them become cold. Pare
twenty-four large apples, which cut in quarters, remove the core, and
stew them in a little water, then press them through a sieve, add half
a pound of powdered sugar and a glass of orange marmalade or quince
jelly. When cold, add the almonds, citron, cherries, and raisins, a
sherry-glass of brandy, the same of maraschino, and put the whole into
a freezer and freeze from ten to fifteen minutes. Then stir into it
rapidly a pint of stiff whipped cream, and put into a mold, which place
in a large bowl, and surround the mold with cracked ice mixed with
about two handfuls of rock salt. Leave it for two hours, then turn it
out of the mold on a dish, surround it with whipped cream, to which you
have added about two ounces of sugar, and flavored with vanilla.

594. =Orange Ice.= Put a quart of water in a saucepan on the fire, with
three quarters of a pound of sugar, which boil ten minutes, remove
from the fire and allow it to become cold. Take the juice of a dozen
oranges and four lemons, strain, rasp a lump of sugar with the rind of
an orange, which add to the juice, mix all together with the water and
sugar, and freeze, as described in Art. 586. Strawberry and raspberry
ice are prepared in the same manner, except that they are pressed
through a sieve.

595. =Pineapple Ice.= For this, take a pint and a half of water,
four lemons, three quarters of a pound of sugar, a pound and a half
of pineapple, which chop fine and pound in a mortar, press through a
sieve, and finish as the above.

596. =Orange Baskets.= Take ten oranges, as large as possible; with
a penknife, or the point of a small, sharp knife, form the handle
of the basket, by beginning at the side of the orange and cutting a
line across the top, stopping just opposite where you have begun. Cut
another line exactly as the first, half an inch apart from it, then cut
around the orange in the middle, stopping at where the handle is marked
out. Remove the two quarters of peel, pass the knife under the handle,
so as to loosen the orange, which remove as carefully as possible, and
proceed in the same manner, so as to remove most of the orange from the
basket, and the remainder scoop out with a teaspoon. Dry the baskets
with a cloth, tie the handles with bows of narrow ribbons of all
colors, fill them with orange ice as the foregoing, and serve.

597. =Roman Punch.= Put in a saucepan on the fire three quarters of a
pound of sugar, with three pints of water, boil ten minutes, then put
aside to become cold. Then put in a freezer, and, when nearly frozen,
stir into it rapidly a gill of rum and the juice of four lemons.




APPENDIX.

_A FEW AMERICAN RECEIPTS FOR BUCKWHEAT CAKES, WAFFLES, ETC._


598. =Buckwheat Cakes.= Mix a cupful of buckwheat meal in a bowl with
enough water to make the consistency of cream; add a pinch of salt and
a wineglass of yeast, and allow it to remain over night; then bake on a
very dry griddle till the cakes are of a light brown.

599. =Wheat Flannel Cakes.= Mix together eight tablespoonfuls of wheat
flour with a gill of yeast, the same of fresh milk, and a little salt;
put in a covered bowl over night to rise, and in the morning bake on a
griddle, and turn the cakes on one side and then on the other, until
both are browned. If the above mixture should become acid, add half a
teaspoonful of soda well mixed in a little water.

600. =Indian Meal Griddle Cakes.= Mix well together with a pint of
Indian meal a quart of milk, a tablespoonful of butter, a little salt,
and two eggs; beat all well together and bake on a griddle.

601. =Corn Bread.= With two teacupfuls of hot hominy mix a liberal
tablespoonful of butter; beat four eggs very light, and stir them into
the hominy and butter; then add gradually a pint of milk, stirring
constantly, and, when thoroughly mixed, half a pint of Indian meal. If
thicker than the consistency of rich boiled custard, add a little more
milk. Bake in a deep pan (so as to allow the mixture to rise), in an
oven which is quite hot at the bottom and not too much so at the top.

602. =Fairies.= With a pint of flour mix a scant tablespoonful of
butter, some salt, and enough water to make a dough which may be
kneaded. When kneaded sufficiently, roll the dough out as thin as a
sheet of paper; cut it in rounds with a muffin-ring, prick them with a
fork, and bake them for an instant in a moderately hot oven.

603. =Waffles.= Dissolve half a pound of fresh butter in a quart
of new milk; then thoroughly mix with the above a quart of flour;
add six fresh eggs which you have previously beaten very light, and
a little salt. Bake in waffle-irons, which should be greased with
good butter after the baking of each waffle. Butter the waffles
while very hot, before serving, and serve with them one and a half
tablespoonfuls of powdered cinnamon, well mixed with six tablespoonfuls
of powdered sugar. When very rich cream may be procured, three or four
tablespoonfuls may be added to the milk in the above receipt.

604. =Gingerbread.= Mix well with a pint of molasses half a pound of
sugar, half a pound of butter, and three eggs. Dissolve an ounce of
baking soda in a pint of water, which add to the above ingredients,
with also an ounce of ground ginger; then add two pounds of flour; mix
all well together, and bake in a moderately hot oven.

605. =Ginger Snaps.= Sift half an ounce of baking soda through a pound
and three quarters of flour; also sift half a pound of sugar through
the flour, which then mix well with half a pound of butter; add half an
ounce of ginger, the same of ground allspice; mix together a pint of
molasses with half a gill of water, which add to the other ingredients,
mixing all thoroughly together; roll out very thin and bake until very
crisp. When ginger snaps are liked very hot, sometimes red pepper is
added.

606. =Cookies.= Take four ounces of butter, three ounces of pulverized
sugar, and six ounces of flour; rub all together until in crumbs;
add two yolks of eggs, which mix thoroughly together with the above
ingredients until quite smooth. Put this mixture on a plate, which
cover with another plate, and let it rest in a cool place for half
an hour; roll it out an eighth of an inch thick, cut it out in small
rounds a little larger than a silver dollar, and bake in a moderate
oven until colored a _very_ light brown; spread some raspberry jam on
half of the rounds, and cover with the other half.

607. =Boiled Potatoes.= Take about twelve potatoes, which wash well in
cold water; peel them, cutting out the eyes or any black specks which
the potatoes may have; then put them in a saucepan in which there
is enough cold water to cover them, sprinkle them over with about a
teaspoonful of salt, and put them on the fire for about half an hour,
then pierce them with a fork, to see if they are thoroughly done; if
so, drain them, place a cloth on top of them, cover the saucepan with
its lid, and put it at the side of the range, to steam the potatoes
until quite dry, and serve them very hot. Some persons prefer them
boiled and served with the skins on, or boiled in their skins and
peeled before serving.

608. =Boiled Rice.= Take three quarters of a pound of rice, which wash
well in cold water, drain and rub the rice with your hands; pick out
the yellow grains and specks of black; then wash the rice again three
or four times, changing the water, and rubbing it with the hands. After
the last time, pour some cold water over it, and put it in a saucepan
on the fire in which there are about five quarts of _boiling_ water.
Stir with a wooden spoon, and add half a teaspoonful of salt. Boil the
rice rapidly for about twenty minutes, skimming off at intervals the
scum which rises. When the rice is soft, drain it, and then pour a
little cold water over it, which also drain instantly. Put the rice,
without any water, into a saucepan, which half cover, and put at the
side of the range. Stir every now and then, and, when the rice is
perfectly dry, serve.
