             Selected Records of Reptiles and Amphibians
                             from Kansas

Preparation of a handbook of reptiles and amphibians by the junior
author has led to a survey of the collections of these animals at Kansas
State Teachers College in Emporia. Numerous locality records of interest
and importance have been accumulated there through the efforts of the
senior author and a number of his students, particularly Mr. Allen
Downs. The more important records, including the first record for Kansas
of _Rana sylvatica_, are reported here. We have not mentioned specimens
that are from counties from which the University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History already has specimens.

Specimens examined by Smith are indicated by an asterisk *; those
identified by the late Dr. F. N. Blanchard are indicated by an encircled
period # (none of these specimens are now available). All other
specimens here recorded have been examined either by the senior author
or by Mr. Allen Downs, or by both. Specimen numbers, unless otherwise
indicated, are those of the Kansas State Teachers College collection.

#Triturus viridescens louisianensis# (Wolterstorff), Newt.--_Cherokee
Co._: 1 mile north and 4 miles east of Crestline (No. 164).* This is a
terrestrial adult, and provides the second known locality for the
species in the state.

#Ambystoma texanum# (Matthes), Narrow-mouthed Salamander.--_Lyon Co._:
Emporia.

#Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium# (Baird), Tiger Salamander.--_Lyon Co._:
(No. 292); 2 miles east of Americus. _Ness Co._: Ness City (No. 591).

#Scaphiopus bombifrons# Cope, Plains Spadefoot.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles
west, 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 592).

#Bufo americanus americanus# (Holbrook), American Toad.--_Chase Co._: 10
miles southwest of Saffordville. _Cherokee Co._: 4 miles southeast of
Columbus. _Lyon Co._: 6 miles south of Plymouth (No. 290)*; Emporia
(Nos. 442, 443).* The records from Chase and Lyon counties represent the
westernmost localities for the species in Kansas.

#Bufo cognatus# Say, Great Plains Toad.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and
1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 594).

#Bufo woodhousii woodhousii# (Girard), Rocky Mountain Toad.--_Clark
Co._: 11 miles south of Bucklin (No. 401).* _Decatur Co._: Sappa Creek
near Oberlin (2 spec.).* _Ford. Co._: 5 miles southwest of Dodge City (1
spec.).* _Lyon Co._: Emporia (No. 352).* _Ness Co._: Ness City (Nos.
502-504, 595, 596)*; 4 miles west, 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No.
593).* _Sheridan Co._: Sheridan County State Park (Nos. 565-568).

#Acris crepitans# Baird, Northern Cricket Frog.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles
west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (Nos. 506, 507, 597-606).*

#Pseudacris nigrita triseriata# (Wied), Striped Chorus Frog.--_Lyon
Co._: 10 miles south of Plymouth; 3 miles north of Emporia (No. 300); 7
miles west of Olpe; 2 miles northeast of Emporia (Nos. 434-441).*
_Neosho Co._: 3 miles west of Erie.

#Hyla versicolor versicolor# (Le Conte), Common Tree Toad.--_Chautauqua
Co._: Elk City (No. 621).

#Rana catesbeiana# Shaw, Bullfrog.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5
miles north of Ness City (No. 607).* _Wallace Co._: 3 miles east of
Sharon Springs (1 spec.).*

#Rana pipiens brachycephala# Cope, Leopard Frog.--_Clark Co._: 11 miles
south of Bucklin (Nos. 398-400).* _Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles
north of Ness City (Nos. 505, 508, 509, 608).*

#Rana sylvatica cantabrigensis# Baird, Wood Frog.--_Lyon Co._: extreme
southwestern corner, 3 miles east of Chase County line, between the
Verdigris River and the corner of the county (1 specimen, now Mus. Nat.
Hist., Univ. Kans., No. 23149).* This specimen provides for the first
time a basis for inclusion of the species in the fauna of Kansas. It
measures 50 mm. snout to vent; hind leg from vent 80 mm.; tibia 23 mm.
The ratio of hind leg to snout-vent measurement is 0.625, and that of
the tibia to snout-vent measurement is 2.17. Both figures are too high
for _Rana s. sylvatica_, in which the former ratio varies between 0.53
and 0.62, the latter ratio between 1.6 and 1.88. The ratios agree well
with those of _R. s. cantabrigensis_, in which the former ratio varies
from 0.62 to 0.75, the latter from 1.93 to 2.3. Direct comparison of the
specimen with typical examples of both subspecies substantiates its
allocation to _R. s. cantabrigensis_.

In the vicinity of Kansas, specimens of this species are known from
Missouri (St. Louis and Stone Counties only) and northwestern Arkansas
(Washington County: Winslow and Prairie Grove, Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ.
Kans., Nos. 16526, 18820, 18823). Reexamination of these specimens
confirms their identity as _Rana sylvatica sylvatica_ to which the
Missouri specimens from Stone County undoubtedly also belong.
Accordingly this race is still to be anticipated in extreme southeastern
Kansas.

Reference of the specimen from Lyon County to _Rana s. cantabrigensis_
presents a problem in distribution, for the race is not known from
nearer Kansas than North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and southern
Illinois, except for a record given by Cope (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No.
34:437, 1889) from "western Missouri." Hurter (Trans. St. Louis Acad.
Sci., 20:123, 1911) restricts this record to Cooper County, and
presumably verifies Cope's identification. Hurter, too, recognized the
other form, _R. sylvatica_, in Missouri (Marble Cave, Stone County).
Cope distinguished between the two races (as they are now recognized)
and recorded typical _R. sylvatica_ from St. Louis. Accordingly the
specimen from Cooper County may be considered properly identified
racially. It apparently is from the locality nearest to Kansas at which
the race has been taken.

It seems highly probable that the Kansas occurrence, and possibly those
in Arkansas and Missouri also, is a relict one. It is highly improbable
that the species has a continuous distribution in either state. A wider
or more southern distribution in the past seems evident. The group to
which it belongs certainly has had a more southern range, as indicated
by Taylor's discovery in Meade County, Kansas (Univ. Kans. Sci. Bull.,
28:217, 1942), of a fossil species of _Rana_ (_parvissima_), from the
Upper Pliocene, presumably related to _sylvatica_. It may or may not
have been a direct ancestor of the living species.
