PREFACE.


John Stuart Mill in his "Autobiography" declares with truth that
"the world would be astonished if it knew how great a proportion
of its brightest ornaments, of those most distinguished even in
popular estimation for wisdom and virtue are complete sceptics in
religion." Many of these, as Mill points out, refrain from various
motives from speaking out. The work I have undertaken will, I trust,
do something to show how many of the world's worthiest men and women
have been Freethinkers.

My Dictionary does not pretend to be a complete list of those who
have rendered services to Freethought. To form such a compilation
would rather be the task of an international society than of an
individual. Moreover details concerning many worthy workers are now
inaccessible. Freethought boasts its noble army of martyrs of whom
the world was not worthy, and who paid the penalty of their freedom
in prison or at the stake. Some of the names of these are only known
by the vituperation of their adversaries. I have done my best to
preserve some trustworthy record of as many as possible.

The only complete work with a similar design of which I have any
knowledge, is the Dictionnaire des Athees anciens et modernes,
by Sylvain Marechal with its supplements by Jerome de Lalande the
Astronomer, An. VIII. (1800)-1805. That work, which is now extremely
rare, gave scarcely any biographical details, and unfortunately
followed previous orthodox atheographers, such as Buddeus, Reimmann,
Hardouin, Garasse, Mersenne, in classing as Atheists those to whom
the title was inapplicable. I have taken no names from these sources
without examining the evidence.

A work was issued by Richard Carlile in 1826, entitled A Dictionary of
Modern Anti-Superstionists; or, "an account, arranged alphabetically,
of those who, whether called Atheists, Sceptics, Latitudinarians,
Religious Reformers, or etc., have during the last ten centuries
contributed towards the diminution of superstition. Compiled by
a searcher after Truth." The compiler, as I have reason to know,
was Julian Hibbert, who brought to his task adequate scholarship
and leisure. It was, however, conceived on too extensive a scale,
and in 128 pages, all that was issued, it only reached to the name of
Annet. Julian Hibbert also compiled chronological tables of English
Freethinkers, which were published in the Reasoner for 1855.

Of the Anti-Trinitarian Biography of the Rev. Robert Wallace, or of
the previous compilations of Saudius and Bock, I have made but little
use. To include the names of all who reject some of the Christian
dogmas was quite beside my purpose, though I have included those of
early Unitarians and Universalists who, I conceive, exhibited the true
spirit of free inquiry in the face of persecution. To the Freydenker
Lexikon of J. A. Trinius (1759) my obligations are slight, but should
be acknowledged. To Bayle's Dictionary, Hoefer's Nouvelle Biographie
Generale, Meyer's Konversations Lexikon, Franck's Dictionnaire des
Sciences Philosophiques, and to Larousse's Grand Dictionnaire Universel
I must also express my indebtedness. In the case of disputed dates
I have usually found Haydn's Dictionary of Biography (1886) most
trustworthy, but I have also consulted Oettinger's valuable Moniteur
des Dates.

The particulars have in all cases been drawn from the best available
sources. I have not attempted to give a full view of any of the lives
dealt with, but merely sought to give some idea of their services and
relation to Freethought. Nor have I enumerated the whole of the works
of authors who have often dealt with a variety of subjects. As full
a list as is feasible has, however, been given of their distinctive
Freethought works; and the book will, I hope, be useful to anyone
wishing information as to the bibliography of Freethought. The only
work of a bibliographical kind is the Guide du Libre Penseur, by
M. Alfred Verliere, but his list is very far from complete even of
the French authors, with whom it is almost entirely occupied. I should
also mention La Lorgnette Philosophique, by M. Paquet, as giving lively
sketches, though not biographies, of some modern French Freethinkers.

In the compilation of my list of names I have received assistance
from my friends, Mr. G. W. Foote (to whom I am also indebted for
the opportunity of publication), Mr. W. J. Birch, Mr. E. Truelove and
Mr. F. Malibran. For particulars in regard to some English Freethinkers
I am indebted to Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, Mr. George Jacob Holyoake and
Mr. E. T. Craig, while Professor Dalla Volta, of Florence, has kindly
assisted me with some of the Italian names. I must also express my
indebtedness to A. de Gubernatis, whose Dizionario Biografico degli
Scrittori Contemporanei I have found of considerable service. My thanks
are also due to G. K. Fortescue, Esq., for permission to examine the
titles of all Freethought works in the British Museum.

Some readers may think my list contains names better omitted, while
omitting others well deserving a place. I have, for instance, omitted
many foreign Liberal Protestants while including Bishop Colenso, who,
ostensibly, did not go so far. But my justification, if any, must be
found in my purpose, which is to record the names of those who have
contributed in their generation to the advance of Freethought. No one
can be more conscious of the imperfections of my work than myself,
but I console myself with the reflection of Plato, that "though it
be the merit of a good huntsman to find game in a wide wood, it is
no discredit if he do not find it all"; and the hope that what I have
attempted some other will complete.

The most onerous part of my task has been the examination of the
claims of some thousand names, mostly foreign, which find no place in
this dictionary. But the work throughout has been a labor of love. I
designed it as my humble contribution to the cause of Freethought, and
leave it with the hope that it will contribute towards the history of
"the good old cause"; a history which has yet to be written, and for
which, perhaps, the time is not yet ripe.

Should this volume be received with an encouraging share of favor,
I hope to follow it with a History of Freethought in England, for
which I have long been collecting materials.






A BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF FREETHINKERS.


Abaelardus (Petrus), b. 1079. A teacher of philosophy at Paris, renowned
for being loved by the celebrated Eloise. He was accused of teaching
erroneous opinions, chiefly about the Creation and the Trinity, and was
condemned by a council at Soissons in 1121 and by that of Sens 1140,
at the instigation of St. Bernard. He was hunted about, but spent
his last days as a monk at Cluni. He died 21 April, 1142. "Abelard,"
observes Hallam, "was almost the first who awakened mankind, in the
age of darkness, to a sympathy with intellectual excellence."

Abano (Petrus de). See Petrus, de Abano.

Abauzit (Firmin), a French writer, descended from an Arabian family
which settled in the South of France early in the ninth century,
b. Uzes, 11 Nov. 1679. He travelled in Holland and became acquainted
with Bayle, attained a reputation for philosophy, and was consulted by
Voltaire and Rousseau. Among his works are, Reflections on the Gospels,
and an essay on the Apocalypse, in which he questions the authority
of that work. Died at Geneva 20 March, 1767. His Miscellanies were
translated in English by E. Harwood, 1774.

Abbot (Francis Ellingwood). American Freethinker, b. Boston, 6
Nov. 1836. He graduated at Harvard University 1859, began life as a
Unitarian minister, but becoming too broad for that Church, resigned
in 1869. He started the Index, a journal of free religious inquiry
and anti-supernaturalism, at Toledo, but since 1874 at Boston. This he
edited 1870-80. In 1872 appeared his Impeachment of Christianity. In
addition to his work on the Index, Mr. Abbot has lectured a great
deal, and has contributed to the North American Review and other
periodicals. He was the first president of the American National
Liberal League. Mr. Abbot is an evolutionist and Theist, and defends
his views in Scientific Theism, 1886.

Ablaing van Giessenburg (R.C.) See Giessenburg.

Abu Bakr Ibn Al-Tufail (Abu J'afar) Al Isbili. Spanish Arabian
philosopher, b. at Guadys, wrote a philosophical romance of pantheistic
tendency Hai Ibn Yakdan, translated into Latin by Pocock, Oxford 1671,
and into English by S. Ockley, 1711, under the title of The Improvement
of Human Reason. Died at Morocco 1185.

Abu-Fazil (Abu al Fadhl ibn Mubarak, called Al Hindi), vizier to
the great Emperor Akbar from 1572. Although by birth a Muhammadan,
his investigations into the religions of India made him see equal
worth in all, and, like his master, Akbar, he was tolerant of all
sects. His chief work is the Ayin Akbary, a statistical account of
the Indian Empire. It was translated by F. Gladwin, 1777. He was
assassinated 1604.

Abul-Abbas-Abdallah III. (Al Mamoun), the seventh Abbasside, caliph,
son of Haroun al Rashid, was b. at Bagdad 16 Sept. 786. He was a patron
of science and literature, collected Greek and Hebrew manuscripts,
and invited the scholars of all nations to his capital. He wrote
several treatises and poems. Died in war near Tarsus, 9 Aug. 833.

Abul-Ola (Ahmad ibn Abd Allah ibn Sulaiman), celebrated Arabian poet,
b. at Maari, in Syria, Dec., 973. His free opinions gave much scandal
to devout Moslems. He was blind through small-pox from the age of
four years, but his poems exhibit much knowledge. He called himself
"the doubly imprisoned captive," in allusion to his seclusion and
loss of sight. He took no pains to conceal that he believed in no
revealed religion. Died May, 1057, and ordered the following verse
to be written on his tomb:--"I owe this to the fault of my father:
none owe the like to mine."

Abu Tahir (al Karmatti), the chief of a freethinking sect at Bahrein,
on the Persian Gulf, who with a comparatively small number of followers
captured Mecca (930), and took away the black stone. He suddenly
attacked, defeated, and took prisoner Abissaj whom, at the head of
thirty thousand men, the caliph had sent against him. Died in 943.

Achillini (Alessandro), Italian physician and philosopher b. Bologna 29
Oct. 1463. He expounded the doctrines of Averroes, and wrote largely
upon anatomy. Died 2 Aug. 1512. His collected works were published
at Venice, 1545.

Ackermann (Louise-Victorine, nee Choquet), French poetess, b. Paris 30
Nov. 1813. She travelled to Germany and there married (1853) a young
theologian, Paul Ackerman, who in preparing for the ministry lost his
Christian faith, and who, after becoming teacher to Prince Frederick
William (afterwards Frederick III.), died at the age of thirty-four
(1846). Both were friends of Proudhon. Madame Ackermann's poems
(Paris 1863-74 and 85) exhibit her as a philosophic pessimist and
Atheist. "God is dethroned," says M. Caro of her poems (Revue des
Deux Mondes, 15 May, 1874). She professes hatred of Christianity
and its interested professors. She has also published Thoughts of a
Solitary. Sainte Beuve calls her "the learned solitary of Nice."

Acollas (Pierre Antoine Rene Paul Emile), French jurisconsult and
political writer, b. La Chatre 25 June, 1826, studied law at Paris. For
participating in the Geneva congress of the International Society
in 1867 he was condemned to one year's imprisonment. In 1871 he was
appointed head of the law faculty by the Commune. He has published
several manuals popularising the legal rights of the people, and has
written on Marriage its Past, Present, and Future, 1880. Mrs. Besant
has translated his monograph on The Idea of God in the Revolution,
published in the Droits de l'Homme.

Acontius (Jacobus--Italian, Giacomo Aconzio). Born at Trent early
in sixteenth century. After receiving ordination in the Church of
Rome he relinquished that faith and fled to Switzerland in 1557. He
subsequently came to England and served Queen Elizabeth as a military
engineer. To her he dedicated his Strategems of Satan, published at
Basle 1565. This was one of the earliest latitudinarian works, and
was placed upon the Index. It was also bitterly assailed by Protestant
divines, both in England and on the Continent. An English translation
appeared in 1648. Some proceedings were taken against Acontius before
Bishop Grindall, of the result of which no account is given. Some
passages of Milton's Areopagitica may be traced to Acontius, who,
Cheynell informs us, lived till 1623. Stephen's Dictionary of National
Biography says he is believed to have died shortly after 1566.

Acosta (Uriel). Born at Oporto 1597, the son of a Christianised Jew;
he was brought up as a Christian, but on reaching maturity, rejected
that faith. He went to Holland, where he published a work equally
criticising Moses and Jesus. For this he was excommunicated by the
Synagogue, fined and put in prison by the Amsterdam authorities,
and his work suppressed. After suffering many indignities from both
Jews and Christians, he committed suicide 1647.

Adams (George), of Bristol, sentenced in 1842 to one month's
imprisonment for selling the Oracle of Reason.

Adams (Robert C.), Canadian Freethought writer and lecturer. Author
of Travels in Faith from Tradition to Reason (New York, 1884), also
Evolution, a Summary of Evidence.

Adler (Felix) Ph. D. American Freethinker, the son of a Jewish rabbi,
was b. in Alzey, Germany, 13 Aug. 1851. He graduated at Columbia
College, 1870, was professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature
at Cornell University from '74 to May '76, when he established in
New York the Society of Ethical Culture, to which he discourses on
Sundays. In 1877 he published a volume entitled Creed and Deed, in
which he rejects supernatural religion. Dr. Adler has also contributed
many papers to the Radical literature of America.

AEnesidemus. A Cretan sceptical philosopher of the first century. He
adopted the principle of Heraclitus, that all things were in course
of change, and argued against our knowledge of ultimate causes.

Airy (Sir George Biddell). English Astronomer Royal, b. Alnwick
27 July, 1801. Educated at Cambridge, where he became senior
wrangler 1823. During a long life Professor Airy did much to advance
astronomical science. His Notes on the Earlier Hebrew Scriptures 1876,
proves him to have been a thorough-going Freethinker.

Aitkenhead (Thomas), an Edinburgh student aged eighteen, who was
indicted for blasphemy, by order of the Privy Council, for having
called the Old Testament "Ezra's Fables," and having maintained
that God and nature were the same. He was found guilty 24 Dec. 1696,
and hanged for blasphemy, 8 Jan. 1697.

Aitzema (Lieuwe van), a nobleman of Friesland, b. at Dorckum 19
Nov. 1600, author of a suppressed History of the Netherlands, between
1621-68. Is classed by Reimmann as an Atheist. Died at the Hague 23
Feb. 1669.

Akbar (Jalal-ed-din Muhammad), the greatest of the emperors of
Hindostan, b. 15 Oct. 1542, was famous for his wide administration and
improvement of the empire. Akbar showed toleration alike to Christians,
Muhammadans, and to all forms of the Hindu faith. He had the Christian
gospels and several Brahmanical treatises translated into Persian. The
result of his many conferences on religion between learned men of
all sects, are collected in the Dabistan. Akbar was brought up as a
Muhammadan, but became a Theist, acknowledging one God, but rejecting
all other dogmas. Died Sept. 1605.

Alberger (John). American author of Monks, Popes, and their Political
Intrigues (Baltimore, 1871) and Antiquity of Christianity (New York,
1874).

Albini (Giuseppe). Italian physiologist, b. Milan. In 1845 he
studied medicine in Paris. He has written on embryology and many
other physiological subjects.

Alchindus. Yakub ibn Is'hak ibn Subbah (Abu Yusuf) called Al Kindi,
Arab physician and philosopher, the great grandson of one of the
companions of Muhammad, the prophet, flourished from 814 to about
840. He was a rationalist in religion, and for his scientific studies
he was set down as a magician.

Alciati (Giovanni Paolo). A Milanese of noble family. At first
a Romanist, he resigned that faith for Calvinism, but gradually
advanced to Anti-trinitarianism, which he defends in two letters
to Gregorio Pauli, dated Austerlitz 1564 and 1565. Beza says that
Alciati deserted the Christian faith and became a Muhammadan, but
Bayle takes pains to disprove this. Died at Dantzic about 1570.

Aleardi (Gaetano). Italian poet, known as Aleardo Aleardi, b. Verona, 4
Nov. 1812. He was engaged in a life-long struggle against the Austrian
dominion, and his patriotic poems were much admired. In 1859 he was
elected deputy to Parliament for Brescia. Died Verona, 16 July, 1878.

Alembert (Jean le Rond d'), mathematician and philosopher, b. at
Paris 16 Nov. 1717. He was an illegitimate son of Canon Destouches
and Mme. Tencin, and received his Christian name from a church
near which he was exposed as a foundling. He afterwards resided
for forty years with his nurse, nor would he leave her for the most
tempting offers. In 1741, he was admitted a member of the Academy of
Sciences. In 1749, he obtained the prize medal from the Academy of
Berlin, for a discourse on the theory of winds. In 1749, he solved the
problem of the procession of the equinoxes and explained the mutation
of the earth's axis. He next engaged with Diderot, with whose opinions
he was in complete accord, in compiling the famous Encyclopedie, for
which he wrote the preliminary discourse. In addition to this great
work he published many historical, philosophical and scientific essays,
and largely corresponded with Voltaire. His work on the Destruction
of the Jesuits is a caustic and far-reaching production. In a letter
to Frederick the Great, he says: "As for the existence of a supreme
intelligence, I think that those who deny it advance more than they
can prove, and scepticism is the only reasonable course." He goes on
to say, however, that experience invincibly proves the materiality of
the "soul." Died 29 Oct. 1783. In 1799 two volumes of his posthumous
essays were printed in Paris. His works prove d'Alembert to have been
of broad spirit and of most extensive knowledge.

Alfieri (Vittorio), Count. Famous Italian poet and dramatist, b. Asti,
Piedmont, 17 Jan. 1749, of a noble family. His tragedies are justly
celebrated, and in his Essay on Tyranny he shows himself as favorable
to religious as to political liberty. Written in his youth, this work
was revised at a more advanced age, the author remarking that if he
had no longer the courage, or rather the fire, necessary to compose
it, he nevertheless retained intelligence, independence and judgment
enough to approve it, and to let it stand as the last of his literary
productions. His attack is chiefly directed against Catholicism,
but he does not spare Christianity. "Born among a people," he says,
"slavish, ignorant, and already entirely subjugated by priests, the
Christian religion knows only how to enjoin the blindest obedience,
and is unacquainted even with the name of liberty." Alfieri's tragedy
of Saul has been prohibited on the English stage. Died Florence,
8 Oct. 1803.

Alfonso X., surnamed the Wise, King of Castillo and of Leon; b. in
1223, crowned 1252. A patron of science and lover of astronomy. He
compiled a complete digest of Roman, feudal and canon law, and
had drawn up the astronomical tables called Alfonsine Tables. By
his liberality and example he gave a great impulse to Spanish
literature. For his intercourse with Jews and Arabians, his
independence towards the Pope and his free disposal of the clerical
revenues, he has been stigmatised as an Atheist. To him is attributed
the well-known remark that had he been present at the creation of the
world he would have proposed some improvements. Father Lenfant adds
the pious lie that "The king had scarcely pronounced this blasphemy
when a thunderbolt fell and reduced his wife and two children to
ashes." Alfonso X. died 4 April, 1284.

Algarotti (Francesco), Count. Italian writer and art critic, b. at
Venice, 11 Dec. 1712. A visit to England led him to write Newtonianism
for the Ladies. He afterwards visited Berlin and became the friend
both of Voltaire and of Frederick the Great, who appointed him his
Chamberlain. Died with philosophical composure at Pisa, 3 May, 1764.

Alger (William Rounseville), b. at Freetown, Massachusetts, 30
Dec. 1822, educated at Harvard, became a Unitarian preacher of the
advanced type. His Critical History of the Doctrine of a Future
Life, with a complete bibliography of the subject by Ezra Abbot,
is a standard work, written from the Universalist point of view.

Allen (Charles Grant Blairfindie), naturalist and author, b. in
Kingston, Canada, 24 Feb. 1848. He studied at Merton College, Oxford,
and graduated with honors 1871. In 1873 appointed Professor of Logic
in Queen's College, Spanish town, Jamaica; from 1874 to '77 he was
its principal. Since then he has resided in England, and become
known by his popular expositions of Darwinism. His published works
include Physiological AEsthetics (1877), The Evolutionist at Large
(1881), Nature Studies (1883), Charles Darwin (1885), and several
novels. Grant Allen has also edited the miscellaneous works of Buckle,
and has written on Force and Energy (1888).

Allen (Ethan) Col., American soldier, b. at Litchfield, Connecticut,
10 Jan. 1737. One of the most active of the revolutionary heroes,
he raised a company of volunteers known as the "Green Mountain Boys,"
and took by surprise the British fortress of Ticonderoga, capturing
100 guns, 10 May, 1775. He was declared an outlaw and L100 offered
for his arrest by Gov. Tryon of New York. Afterwards he was taken
prisoner and sent to England. At first treated with cruelty, he was
eventually exchanged for another officer, 6 May, 1778. He was a member
of the state legislature, and succeeded in obtaining the recognition
of Vermont as an independent state. He published in 1784 Reason
the only Oracle of Man, the first publication in the United States
openly directed against the Christian religion. It has been frequently
reprinted and is still popular in America. Died Burlington, Vermont,
13 Feb. 1789. A statue is erected to him at Montpelier, Vermont.

Allsop (Thomas). "The favorite disciple of Coleridge," b. 10 April,
1794, near Wirksworth, Derbyshire, he lived till 1880. A friend
of Robert Owen and the Chartists. He was implicated in the attempt
of Orsini against Napoleon III. In his Letters, Conversations and
Recollections of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, he has imported many of
his Freethought views.

Alm (Richard von der). See Ghillany (F. W.)

Alpharabius (Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Tarkhan) (Abu Nasr), called
Al Farabi, Turkish philosopher, termed by Ibn Khallikan the greatest
philosopher the Moslems ever had, travelled to Bagdad, mastered
the works of Aristotle, and became master of Avicenna. Al Farabi is
said to have taught the eternity of the world and to have denied the
permanent individuality of the soul. His principal work is a sort
of encyclopaedia. Renan says he expressly rejected all supernatural
revelation. Died at Damascus Dec. 950, aged upwards of eighty.

Amaury or Amalric de Chartres, a heretic of the thirteenth century,
was a native of Bene, near Chartres, and lived at Paris, where he gave
lessons in logic. In a work bearing the title of Physion, condemned
by a bull of Pope Innocent III. (1204), he is said to have taught a
kind of Pantheism, and that the reign of the Father and Son must give
place to that of the Holy Spirit. Ten of his disciples were burnt at
Paris 20 Dec. 1210, and the bones of Amaury were exhumed and placed
in the flames.

Amberley (John Russell) Viscount, eldest son of Earl Russell,
b. 1843. Educated at Harrow, Edinburgh and Trinity College,
Cambridge, where ill-health prevented him reading for honors. He
entered Parliament in 1866 as Radical member for Nottingham. Lord
Amberley contributed thoughtful articles to the North British,
the Fortnightly and Theological Reviews, and will be remembered by
his bold Analysis of Religious Belief (1876), in which he examines,
compares and criticises the various faiths of the world. Lord Amberley
left his son to be brought up by Mr. Spalding, a self-taught man of
great ability and force of character; but the will was set aside, on
appeal to the Court of Chancery, in consideration of Mr. Spalding's
heretical views. Died 8 Jan. 1876.

Amman (Hans Jacob), German surgeon and traveller, b. Lake Zurich
1586. In 1612 he went to Constantinople, Palestine and Egypt, and
afterwards published a curious book called Voyage in the Promised
Land. Died at Zurich, 1658.

Ammianus (Marcellinus). Roman soldier-historian of the fourth century,
b. at Antioch. He wrote the Roman history from the reign of Nerva to
the death of Valens in thirty-one books, of which the first thirteen
are lost. His history is esteemed impartial and trustworthy. He served
under Julian, and compares the rancor of the Christians of the period
to that of wild beasts. Gibbon calls him "an accurate and faithful
guide." Died about 395 A.D.

Ammonius, surnamed Saccas or the Porter, from his having been obliged
in the early part of his life to adopt that calling, was born of
Christian parents in Alexandria during the second century. He,
however, turned Pagan and opened a school of philosophy. Among his
pupils were Origen, Longinus and Plotinus. He undoubtedly originated
the Neo-Platonic movement, which formed the most serious opposition
to Christianity in its early career. Ammonius died A.D. 243, aged
over eighty years.

Anaxagoras, a Greek philosopher of the Ionic school, b. about 499 B.C.,
lived at Athens and enjoyed the friendship of Pericles. In 450 B.C. he
was accused of Atheism for maintaining the eternity of matter and was
banished to Lampsacus, where he died in 428 B.C. It is related that,
being asked how he desired to be honored after death, he replied,
"Only let the day of my death be observed as a holiday by the boys
in the schools." He taught that generation and destruction are only
the union and separation of elements which can neither be created
nor annihilated.

Andre-Nuytz (Louis), author of Positivism for All, an elementary
exposition of Positive philosophy, to which Littre wrote a preface,
1868.

Andrews (Stephen Pearl). American Sociologist, b. Templeton, Mass.,
22 March, 1812. He was an ardent Abolitionist, an eloquent speaker,
and the inventor of a universal language called Alwato. His principle
work is entitled The Basic Outline of Universology (N. Y., 1872). He
also wrote The Church and Religion of the Future (1886). He was a
prominent member and vice-president of the Liberal Club of New York,
a contributor to the London Times, the New York Truthseeker, and many
other journals. Died at New York, 21 May, 1886.

Andrieux (Louis). French deputy, b. Trevoux 20 July, 1840. Was
called to the bar at Lyons, where he became famous for his political
pleading. He took part in the Freethought Congress at Naples in 1869,
and in June of the following year he was imprisoned for three months
for his attack on the Empire. On the establishment of the Republic he
was nominated procureur at Lyons. He was on the municipal council of
that city, which he has also represented in the Chamber of Deputies. In
1879 he became Prefect of Police at Paris, but retired in 1881 and was
elected deputy by his constituents at Lyons. He has written Souvenirs
of a Prefect of Police (1885).

Angelucci (Teodoro). Italian poet and philosopher, b. near Tolentino
1549. He advocated Aristotle against F. Patrizi, and was banished
from Rome. One of the first emancipators of modern thought in Italy,
he also made an excellent translation of the AEneid of Virgil. Died
Montagnana, 1600.

Angiulli (Andrea). Italian Positivist, b. Castellana 12 Feb. 1837,
author of a work on philosophy and Positive research, Naples 1868. He
became professor of Anthropology at Naples in 1876, and edits a
philosophical review published in that city since 1881.

Annet (Peter). One of the most forcible writers among the English
Deists, b. at Liverpool in 1693. He was at one time a schoolmaster
and invented a system of shorthand. Priestley learnt it at school
and corresponded with Annet. In 1739 he published a pamphlet on
Freethinking the Great Duty of Religion, by P. A., minister of
religion. This was followed by the Conception of Jesus as the
Foundation of the Christian Religion, in which he boldly attacks
the doctrine of the Incarnation as "a legend of the Romanists,"
and The Resurrection of Jesus Considered (1744) in answer to Bishop
Sherlock's Trial of the Witnesses. This controversy was continued in
The Resurrection Reconsidered and The Resurrection Defenders Stript
of all Defence. In An Examination of the History and Character of
St. Paul he attacks the sincerity of the apostle to the Gentiles and
even questions the authenticity of his epistles. In Supernaturals
Examined (1747) he argues that all miracles are incredible. In 1761
he issued nine numbers of the Free Inquirer, in which he attacked
the authenticity and credibility of the Pentateuch. For this he was
brought before the King's Bench and sentenced to suffer one month's
imprisonment in Newgate, to stand twice in the pillory, once at
Charing Cross and once at the Exchange, with a label "For Blasphemy,"
then to have a year's hard labor in Bridewell and to find sureties
for good behavior during the rest of his life. It is related that
a woman seeing Annet in the pillory said, "Gracious! pilloried for
blasphemy. Why, don't we blaspheme every day!" After his release Annet
set up a school at Lambeth. Being asked his views on a future life
he replied by this apologue: "One of my friends in Italy, seeing the
sign of an inn, asked if that was the Angel." "No," was the reply,
"do you not see it is the sign of a dragon." "Ah," said my friend,
"as I have never seen either angel or dragon, how can I tell whether
it is one or the other?" Died 18 Jan. 1769. The History of the Man
after God's Own Heart (1761) ascribed to Annet, was more probably
written by Archibald Campbell. The View of the Life of King David
(1765) by W. Skilton, Horologist, is also falsely attributed to Annet.

Anthero de Quental, Portuguese writer, b. San Miguel 1843. Educated
for the law at the University of Coimbra, he has published both poetry
and prose, showing him to be a student of Hartmann, Proudhon and Renan,
and one of the most advanced minds in Portugal.

Anthony (Susan Brownell). American reformer, b. of a Quaker family
at South Adams, Massachusetts, 15 Feb. 1820. She became a teacher,
a temperance reformer, an opponent of slavery, and an ardent advocate
of women's rights. Of the last movement she became secretary. In
conjunction with Mrs. E. C. Stanton and Parker Pillsbury she conducted

was, however, acquitted. Died at Arles, 26 Nov. 1817.

Antoninus (Marcus Aurelius). See Aurelius.

Apelt (Ernst Friedrich), German philosopher, b. Reichenau 3 March,
1812. He criticised the philosophy of religion from the standpoint
of reason, and wrote many works on metaphysics. Died near Gorlitz,
27 Oct. 1859.

Aquila, a Jew of Pontus, who became a proselyte to Christianity, but
afterwards left that religion. He published a Greek version of the
Hebrew scriptures to show that the prophecies did not apply to Jesus
(A.D. 128). The work is lost. He has been identified by E. Deutsch
with the author of the Targum of Onkelos.

Arago (Dominique Francois Jean), French academician, politician,
physicist and astronomer, b. Estagel, 26 Feb. 1786. He was elected to
the French Academy of Sciences at the age of twenty-three. He made
several optical and electro-magnetic discoveries, and advocated
the undulatory theory of light. He was an ardent Republican and
Freethinker, and took part in the provisional Government of 1848. He
opposed the election of Louis Napoleon, and refused to take the
oath of allegiance after the coup d'etat of December, 1851. Died 2

28 Jan. 1828, was intended for the Church, but took to philosophy. In
1869 he published a discourse on Peitro Pomponazzi, followed next year
by Psychology as a Positive Science. Signor Ardigo has also written on
the formation of the solar system and on the historical formation of
the ideas of God and the soul. An edition of his philosophical works
was commenced at Mantua in 1882. Ardigo is one of the leaders of the
Italian Positivists. His Positivist Morals appeared in Padua 1885.

Argens (Jean Baptiste de Boyer) Marquis d', French writer, b. at
Aix, in Provence, 24 June 1704. He adopted a military life and
served with distinction. On the accession of Frederick the Great
he invited d'Argens to his court at Berlin, and made him one of his
chamberlains. Here he resided twenty-five years and then returned to
Aix, where he resided till his death 11 June, 1771. His works were
published in 1768 in twenty-four volumes. Among them are Lettres
Juives, Lettres Chinoises and Lettres Cabalistiques, which were
joined to La Philosophie du bon sens. He also translated Julian's
discourse against Christianity and Ocellus Lucanus on the Eternity
of the World. Argens took Bayle as his model, but he was inferior to
that philosopher.

Argental (Charles Augustin de Ferriol) Count d', French diplomat,
b. Paris 20 Dec. 1700, was a nephew of Mme. de Tencin, the mother
of D'Alembert. He is known for his long and enthusiastic friendship
for Voltaire. He was said to be the author of Memoires du Comte de
Comminge and Anecdotes de la cour d'Edouard. Died 5 Jan. 1788.

Aristophanes, great Athenian comic poet, contemporary with Socrates,
Plato, and Euripides, b. about 444 B.C. Little is known of his life. He
wrote fifty-four plays, of which only eleven remain, and was crowned
in a public assembly for his attacks on the oligarchs. With the utmost
boldness he satirised not only the the political and social evils
of the age, but also the philosophers, the gods, and the theology
of the period. Plato is said to have died with Aristophanes' works
under his pillow. Died about 380 B.C.

Aristotle, the most illustrious of ancient philosophers, was born at
Stagyra, in Thrace, 384 B.C. He was employed by Philip of Macedon
to instruct his son Alexander. His inculcation of ethics as apart
from all theology, justifies his place in this list. After the death
of Alexander, he was accused of impiety and withdrew to Chalcis,
where he died B.C. 322. Grote says: "In the published writings of
Aristotle the accusers found various heretical doctrines suitable for
sustaining their indictment; as, for example, the declaration that
prayer and sacrifices to the gods were of no avail." His influence
was predominant upon philosophy for nearly two thousand years. Dante
speaks of him as "the master of those that know."

Arnold of Brescia, a pupil of Abelard. He preached against the papal
authority and the temporal power, and the vices of the clergy. He
was condemned for heresy by a Lateran Council in 1139, and retired
from Italy. He afterwards returned to Rome and renewed his exertions
against sacerdotal oppression, and was eventually seized and burnt at
Rome in 1155. Baronius calls him "the patriarch of political heretics."

Arnold (Matthew), LL.D. poet and critic, son of Dr. Arnold of Rugby,
b. at Laleham 24 Dec. 1822. Educated at Winchester, Rugby, and Oxford,
where he won the Newdigate prize. In 1848 he published the Strayed
Reveller, and other Poems, signed A. In 1851 he married and became
an inspector of schools. In 1853 appeared Empedocles on Etna, a poem
in which, under the guise of ancient teaching he gives much secular
philosophy. In 1857 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford. In
1871 he published an essay entitled St. Paul and Protestantism; in 1873
Literature and Dogma, which, from its rejection of supernaturalism,
occasioned much stir and was followed by God and the Bible. In 1877
Mr. Arnold published Last Essays on Church and State. Mr. Arnold
has a lucid style and is abreast of the thought of his age, but he
curiously unites rejection of supernaturalism, including a personal
God, with a fond regard for the Church of England. He may be said
in his own words to wander "between two worlds, one dead, the other
powerless to be born." Died 15 April, 1888.

Arnould (Arthur), French writer, b. Dieuze 7 April, 1833. As
journalist he wrote on l'Opinion Nationale, the Rappel, Reforme and
other papers. In 1864 he published a work on Beranger, and in '69 a

Arthur (John) is inserted in Marechal's Dictionnaire des Athees
as a mechanic from near Birmingham, who took a prize at Paris and
republished the Invocation to Nature in the last pages of the System
of Nature. Julian Hibbert inserted his name in his Chronological
Tables of Anti-Superstitionists, with the date of death 1792.

Asseline (Louis). French writer, b. at Versailles in 1829, became an
advocate in 1851. In 1866 he established La Libre Pensee, a weekly
journal of scientific materialism, and when that was suppressed
La Pensee Nouvelle. He was one of the founders of the Encyclopedie
Generale. He wrote Diderot and the Nineteenth Century, and contributed
to many journals. After the revolution of 4 Sept. 1870 he was elected
mayor of the fourteenth arrondissement of Paris, and was afterwards
one of the Municipal Council of that city. Died 6 April, 1878.

Assezat (Jules). French writer, b. at Paris 21 Jan. 1832 was a son
of a compositor on the Journal des Debats, on which Jules obtained a

Atkinson (Henry George). Philosophic writer, b. in 1818. Was educated
at the Charterhouse, gave attention to mesmerism, and wrote in
the Zoist. In 1851 he issued Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature
and Development, in conjunction with Harriet Martineau, to whom he
served as philosophic guide. This work occasioned a considerable
outcry. Mr. Atkinson was a frequent contributor to the National
Reformer and other Secular journals. He died 28 Dec. 1884, at Boulogne,
where he had resided since 1870.

Aubert de Verse (Noel). A French advocate of the seventeenth century,

Aurelius (Marcus Antoninus). Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher, b. at
Rome 26 April, 121. Was carefully educated, and lived a laborious,
abstemious life. On the death of his uncle Antoninus Pius, 161, the
Senate obliged him to take the government, but he associated with
himself L. Verus. On the death of Verus in 169 Antoninus possessed
sole authority, which he exercised with wise discretion and great
glory. Much of his time was employed in defending the northern
frontiers of the empire against Teutonic barbarians. He had no
high opinion of Christians, speaking of their obstinacy, and it is
pretended many were put to death in the reign of one of the best
emperors that ever ruled. If so we may be assured it was for their
crimes. Ecclesiastical historians have invented another pious miracle
in a victory gained through the prayers of the Christians. Antoninus
held that duty was indispensable even were there no gods. His
Meditations, written in the midst of a most active life, breathe a
lofty morality, and are a standing refutation of the view that pure
ethics depend upon Christian belief. Died 17 March, 180.

Austin (Charles), lawyer and disciple of Bentham, b. Suffolk 1799. At
Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1824 and M.A. in 1827, he won,
much to the amazement of his friends, who knew his heterodox opinions,
the Hulsean prize for an essay on Christian evidences. For this he
was sorry afterwards, and told Lord Stanley of Alderley "I could
have written a much better essay on the other side." He afterwards
wrote on the other side in the Westminster Review. Successful as a
lawyer, he retired in ill-health. J. S. Mill writes highly of his
influence. The Hon. L. A. Tollemache gives a full account of his
heretical opinions. He says "He inclined to Darwinism, because as he
said, it is so antecedently probable; but, long before this theory
broke the back of final causes, he himself had given them up." Died
21 Dec. 1874.

Austin (John), jurist, brother of above, was born 3 March, 1790. A
friend of James Mill, Grote and Bentham, whose opinions he shared,

quitted about 1120, and became vizier at the court of Fez, where he
died about 1138. An admirer of Aristotle, he was one of the teachers
of Averroes. Al-Fath Ibn Khakan represents him as an infidel and
Atheist, and says: "Faith disappeared from his heart and left not a
trace behind; his tongue forgot the Merciful, neither did [the holy]
name cross his lips." He is said to have suffered imprisonment for
his heterodoxy.

Avenel (Georges), French writer, b. at Chaumont 31 Dec. 1828. One of
the promoters of the Encyclopedie Generale. His vindication of Cloots
(1865) is a solid work of erudition. He became editor of la Republique
Francaise and edited the edition of Voltaire published by Le Siecle
(1867-70). Died at Bougival, near Paris, 1 July, 1876, and was,
by his express wish, buried without religious ceremony.

Averroes (Muhammad Ibn-Ahmad Ibn Rushd), Abu al Walid, Arabian
philosopher, b. at Cordova in 1126, and died at Morocco 10
Dec. 1198. He translated and commented upon the works of Aristotle,
and resolutely placed the claims of science above those of theology. He
was prosecuted for his heretical opinions by the Muhammadan doctors,
was spat upon by all who entered the mosque at the hour of prayer,
and afterwards banished. His philosophical opinions, which incline
towards materialism and pantheism, had the honor of being condemned
by the University of Paris in 1240. They were opposed by St. Thomas
Aquinas, and when profoundly influencing Europe at the Renaissance
through the Paduan school were again condemned by Pope Leo X. in 1513.

Avicenna (Husain Ibn Abdallah, called Ibn Sina), Arabian physician and
philosopher, b. Aug. 980 in the district of Bokhara. From his early
youth he was a wonderful student, and at his death 15 June, 1037,

Bailey (Samuel), philosophical writer, of Sheffield, b. in 1791. His
essay on the Formation and Publication of Opinions appeared in 1821. He
vigorously contends that man is not responsible for his opinions
because they are independent of his will, and that opinions should
not be the subject of punishment. Another anonymous Freethought work
was Letters from an Egyptian Kaffir on a Visit to England in Search
of Religion. This was at first issued privately 1839, but afterwards
printed as a Reasoner tract. He also wrote The Pursuit of Truth,
1829, and a Theory of Reasoning, 1851. He was acquainted with both

Bailey (William S.), editor of the Liberal, published in Nashville,
Tennessee, was an Atheist up till the day of death, March, 1886. In
a slave-holding State, he was the earnest advocate of abolition.

Baillie (George), of Garnet Hill, Glasgow. Had been a sheriff in one
of the Scotch counties. He was a liberal subscriber to the Glasgow
Eclectic Institute. In 1854 he offered a prize for the best essay on
Christianity and Infidelity, which was gained by Miss Sara Hennell. In
1857 another prize was restricted to the question whether Jesus
prophesied the coming of the end of the world in the life-time of his
followers. It was gained by Mr. E. P. Meredith, and is incorporated
in his Prophet of Nazareth. In 1863 Mr. Baillie divested himself
of his fortune (L18,000) which was to be applied to the erection
and endowment of an institution to aid the culture of the operative

The Intellect, and in 1859 The Emotions and the Will, constituting
together a systematic exposition of the human mind. From 1860 to
1880 he occupied the Chair of Logic in the University of Aberdeen,
his accession being most obnoxious to the orthodox, and provoking
disorder among the students. In 1869 he received the degree of
LL.D. In addition to numerous educational works Dr. Bain published a
Compendium of Mental and Moral Science (1868), Mind and Body (1875),
and Education as a Science (1879), for the International Scientific

of the Supplycacion of Beggars, an attack upon the clergy of the
period. In 1531 he was accused of heresy, having among other things
denied transubstantiation, the confessional, and "the power of the
keys." It was asserted that he had said that he would as lief pray
to his wife as to "our lady," and that Christ was but a man. This
he denied, but admitted holding the salvation of unbelievers. He was
burnt 30 April, 1532.

Baissac (Jules), French litterateur, b. Vans, 1827, author of several

studied the Hegelian philosophy, and published some philosophical
writings under the name of Jules Elisard. In '43 he visited Paris and
became a disciple of Proudhon. In '48 he was expelled from France
at the demand of Russia, whose government set the price of 10,000
silver roubles on his head, went to Dresden and became a member of the
insurrectionary government. He was arrested and condemned to death,
May '50, but his sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life. He
escaped into Austria, was again captured and sentenced to death,

professor at the Academy of Sora, in Denmark, 1753-1761, and at
Altona, 1761-1768. While here he published Philalethea, the Grounds of
Religion, and other heterodox works, which excited so much prejudice
that he was in danger of being stoned. He devoted much attention to
improving methods of teaching. Died at Magdeburg 25 July, 1790.

Baskerville (John), famous printer, b. Sion Hill, Wolverley,
Worcestershire, 28 Jan. 1706. Lived at Birmingham. He was at
first a stone-mason, then made money as an artistic japanner, and
devoted it to perfecting the art of type-founding and printing. As
a printer-publisher he produced at his own risk beautiful editions
of Milton, Addison, Shaftesbury, Congreve, Virgil, Horace, Lucretius,
Terence, etc. He was made printer to Cambridge University 1758. Wilkes
once visited him and was "shocked at his infidelity" (!) He died
8 Jan. 1775, and was buried in a tomb in his own garden. He had
designed a monumental urn with this inscription: "Stranger, beneath
this cone in unconsecrated ground a friend to the liberties of
mankind directed his body to be inurned. May the example contribute
to emancipate thy mind from the idle fears of superstition and the
wicked arts of priesthood." His will expresses the utmost contempt
for Christianity. His type was appropriately purchased to produce a
complete edition of Voltaire.

Bassus (Aufidus). An Epicurean philosopher and friend of Seneca in
the time of Nero. Seneca praises his patience and courage in the
presence of death.

Bate (Frederick), Socialist, author of The Student 1842, a drama

the son of a distinguished friend of Cabanis and Condorcet. He
first became famous by the publication of Fleurs du Mal, 1857, in
which appeared Les Litanies de Satan. The work was prosecuted and
suppressed. Baudelaire translated some of the writings of E. A. Poe,
a poet whom he resembled much in life and character. The divine
beauty of his face has been celebrated by the French poet, Theodore
de Banville, and his genius in some magnificent stanzas by the English
poet, Algernon Swinburne. Died Paris 31 Aug. 1867.

Baudon (P. L.), French author of a work on the Christian Superstition,
published at Brussels in 1862 and dedicated to Bishop Dupanloup under
the pseudonym of "Aristide."

Bauer (Bruno), one of the boldest biblical critics of Germany,
b. Eisenberg, 6 Sept. 1809. Educated at the University of Berlin,
in 1834 he received a professorship of theology. He first attained
celebrity by a review of the Life of Jesus by Strauss (1835). This
was followed by his Journal of Speculative Theology and Critical
Exposition of the Religion of the Old Testament. He then proceeded
to a Review of the Gospel History, upon the publication of which
(1840) he was deprived of his professorship at Bonn. To this followed
Christianity Unveiled (1843), which was destroyed at Zurich before
its publication. This work continued his opposition to religion,
which was carried still further in ironical style in his Proclamation
of the Day of Judgement concerning Hegel the Atheist. Bauer's heresy
deepened with age, and in his Review of the Gospels and History of
their Origin (1850), to which Apostolical History is a supplement,
he attacked the historical truth of the New Testament narratives. In
his Review of the Epistles attributed to St. Paul (1852) he tries to
show that the first four epistles, which had hardly ever before been
questioned, were not written by Paul, but are the production of the
second century. In his Christ and the Caesars he shows the influence
of Seneca and Greco-Roman thought upon early Christianity. He died
near Berlin, 13 April, 1882.

Bauer (Edgar), b. Charlottenburg, 7 Oct. 1820, brother of the
preceding, collaborated in some of his works. His brochure entitled

Baur (Ferdinand Christian von), distinguished theological critic, b. 21
June, 1792, near Stuttgart. His father was a clergyman. He was educated
at Tuebingen, where in 1826 he became professor of Church history. Baur
is the author of numerous works on dogmatic and historic theology, in
which he subverts all the fundamental positions of Christianity. He was
an Hegelian Pantheist. Among his more important works are Christianity
and the Church in the First Three Centuries and Paul: His Life and
Works. These are translated into English. He acknowledges only four
of the epistles of Paul and the Revelation as genuine products of
the apostolic age, and shows how very far from simplicity were the
times and doctrines of primitive Christianity. After a life of great
literary activity he died at Tuebingen, 2 Dec. 1860.

Bayle (Pierre), learned French writer, b. 18 Nov. 1647, at Carlat,
France, where his father was a Protestant minister. He was converted
to Romanism while studying at the Jesuit College, Toulouse, 1669. His
Romanism only lasted seventeen months. He abjured, and fled to
Switzerland, becoming a sceptic, as is evident from Thoughts on the
Comet, in which he compares the supposed mischiefs of Atheism with
those of fanaticism, and from many articles in his famous Dictionnaire
Critique, a work still of value for its curious learning and shrewd
observation. In his journal Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres
he advocates religious toleration on the ground of the difficulty of
distinguishing truth from error. His criticism of Maimbourg's History
of Calvinism was ordered to be burnt by the hangman. Jurieu persecuted
him, and he was ordered to be more careful in preparing the second
edition of his dictionary. He died at Rotterdam, 28 Dec. 1706. Bayle
has been called the father of free discussion in modern times.

Bayrhoffer (Karl Theodor), German philosopher, b. Marburg, 14 Oct.,

the author of the History of Manicheanism. He was educated first at
Frankfort-on-Oder, then at Paris. He wrote on the scepticism of the
wise (Pyrrhonisme du Sage, Berlin, 1754), a work condemned to be burnt
by the Parliament of Paris. He also wrote anonymously The Dreams of

Positive Polity, and has published several pamphlets on political
and social questions.

Beethoven (Ludwig van), one of the greatest of musical composers,
b. Bonn 16 Dec. 1770. His genius early displayed itself, and at the
age of five he was set to study the works of Handel and Bach. His many
compositions are the glory of music. They include an opera "Fidelio,"
two masses, oratorios, symphonies, concertos, overtures and sonatas,
and are characterised by penetrating power, rich imagination, intense
passion, and tenderness. When about the age of forty he became totally
deaf, but continued to compose till his death at Vienna, 26 March,
1827. He regarded Goethe with much the same esteem as Wagner showed
for Schopenhauer, but he disliked his courtliness. His Republican
sentiments are well known, and Sir George Macfarren, in his life in
the Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography, speaks of him as a
"Freethinker," and says the remarkable mass in C. "might scarcely
have proceeded from an entirely orthodox thinker." Sir George Grove,
in his Dictionary of Music and Musicians, says: "Formal religion he
apparently had none," and "the Bible does not appear to have been one
of his favorite books." At the end of his arrangement of "Fidelio"
Moscheles had written, "Fine. With God's help." To this Beethoven
added, "O man, help thyself."

Bekker (Balthasar), Dutch Rationalist, b. Metslawier (Friesland)
20 March, 1634. He studied at Gronigen, became a doctor of divinity,
and lived at Francker, but was accused of Socinianism, and had to fly
to Amsterdam, where he raised another storm by his World Bewitched
(1691), a work in which witchcraft and the power of demons are
denied. His book, which contains much curious information, raised
a host of adversaries, and he was deposed from his place in the
Church. It appeared in English in 1695. Died, Amsterdam, 11 June,
1698. Bekker was remarkably ugly, and he is said to have "looked like
the devil, though he did not believe in him."

Belinsky (Vissarion Grigorevich), Russian critic, b. Pensa 1811,
educated at Pensa and Moscow, adopted the Pantheistic philosophy of
Hegel and Schelling. Died St. Petersburg, 28 May, 1848. His works
were issued in 12 volumes, 1857-61.

Bell (Thomas Evans), Major in Madras Army, which he entered in 1842. He
was employed in the suppression of Thugee. He wrote the Task of To-Day,
1852, and assisted the Reasoner, both with pen and purse, writing over
the signature "Undecimus." He contemplated selling his commission to
devote himself to Freethought propaganda, but by the advice of his
friends was deterred. He returned to India at the Mutiny. In January,
1861, he became Deputy-Commissioner of Police at Madras. He retired
in July, 1865, and has written many works on Indian affairs. Died 12
Sept. 1887.

Bell (William S.), b. in Allegheny city, Pennsylvania, 10
Feb. 1832. Brought up as a Methodist minister, was denounced for
mixing politics with religion, and for his anti-slavery views. In

lecturer. He has published a little book on the French Revolution,
and some pamphlets.

Bender (Wilhelm), German Rationalist, professor of theology at Bonn,

and must be carried on by the Rationalists.

Bennett (De Robigne Mortimer), founder and editor of the New York
Truthseeker, b. of poor parents, Springfield (N.Y.), 23 Dec. 1818. At
the age of fifteen he joined the Shaker Society in New Lebanon. Here
he stayed thirteen years and then married. Having lost faith in the
Shaker creed, he went to Louisville, Kentucky, where he started a
drug store. The perusal of Paine, Volney, and similar works made him
a Freethinker. In 1873, his letters to a local journal in answer to
some ministers having been refused, he resolved to start a paper of
his own. The result was the Truthseeker, which in January, 1876 became
a weekly, and has since become one of the principal Freethought organs
in America. In 1879 he was sentenced to thirteen months' imprisonment
for sending through the post a pamphlet by Ezra H. Heywood on the
marriage question. A tract, entitled An Open Letter to Jesus Christ,
was read in court to bias the jury. A petition bearing 200,000
names was presented to President Hayes asking his release, but was
not acceded to. Upon his release his admirers sent him for a voyage
round the world. He wrote A Truthseeker's Voyage Round the World,
Letters from Albany Penitentiary, Answers to Christian Questions and
Arguments, two large volumes on The Gods, another on the World's Sages,
Infidels and Thinkers, and published his discussions with Humphrey,
Mair, and Teed, and numerous tracts. He died 6 Dec. 1882.

economy, b. 15 Feb. 1748. A grand uncle named Woodward was the
publisher of Tindal's Christianity as Old as the Creation. Was educated
at Westminster and Oxford, where he graduated M.A. 1767. Bentham
is justly regarded as the father of the school of philosophical
Radicalism. In philosophy he is the great teacher of Utilitarianism;
as a jurist he did much to disclose the defects of and improve our
system of law. Macaulay says he "found jurisprudence a gibberish and
left it a science." His most pronounced Freethought work was that
written in conjunction with Grote, published as An Analysis of the
Influence of Natural Religion, by Philip Beauchamp, 1822. Among his
numerous other works we can only mention Deontology, or the Science
of Mortality, an exposition of utilitarianism; Church of Englandism
and its Catechism Examined; Not Paul, but Jesus, published under the
pseudonym of Gamaliel Smith. Died 6 June, 1832, leaving his body for
the purposes of science.

Beranger (Jean Pierre de), celebrated French lyrical poet,
b. Paris, 19 Aug. 1780. His satire on the Bourbons twice ensured
for him imprisonment. He was elected to the Constituant Assembly

breathe the spirit of liberty, and several have been characterised
as impious. He died 16 July, 1857.

professor at Pisa from 1628 till 1640, and then went to Padua. His
Circulus Pisanus, published in 1643, was considered an Atheistic
work. In the form of a dialogue he exhibits the various hypotheses
of the formation of the world. The work was forbidden and is very
rare. His book entitled Dubitationes in Dialogum Galilaei, also brought
on him a charge of scepticism. Died in 1664.

Berkenhout (Dr. John), physician and miscellaneous writer, b. 1731,
the son of a Dutch merchant who settled at Leeds. In early life he
had been a captain both in the Prussian and English service, and

medical science, a synopsis of the natural history of Great Britain
and Ireland, and several humorous pieces, anonymously. His principal
work is entitled Biographia Literaria, a biographical history of

of displaying his hostility to the theologians, and is loud in his
praises of Voltaire. Died 3 April, 1791.

b. Isere, 11 Dec. 1803. He obtained fame by his dramatic symphony
of Romeo and Juliet (1839), and was made chevalier of the Legion

Berquin (Louis de), French martyr, b. in Artois, 1489. Erasmus,
his friend, says his great crime was openly professing hatred of
the monks. In 1523 his works were ordered to be burnt, and he was
commanded to abjure his heresies. Sentence of perpetual banishment
was pronounced on him on April 16, 1529. He immediately appealed to
the Parliament. His appeal was heard and rejected on the morning of
the 17th. The Parliament reformed the judgment and condemned him to
be burnt alive, and the sentence was carried out on the same afternoon
at the Place de la Greve. He died with great constancy and resolution.

Bert (Paul), French scientist and statesman, b. at Auxerre, 17
Oct. 1833. In Paris he studied both law and medicine, and after
being Professor in the Faculty of Science at Bordeaux, he in 1869
obtained the chair of physiology in the Faculty of Science at Paris,
and distinguished himself by his scientific experiments. In '70 he
offered his services to the Government of National Defence, and in
'72 was elected to the National Assembly, where he signalised himself
by his Radical opinions. Gambetta recognised his worth and made him
Minister of Public Instruction, in which capacity he organised French
education on a Secular basis. His First Year of Scientific Instruction
is almost universally used in the French primary schools. It has been
translated into English by Josephine Clayton (Madame Paul Bert). His
strong anti-clerical views induced much opposition. He published
several scientific and educational works and attacked The Morality of
the Jesuits, '80. In '86 he was appointed French Resident Minister at

Besant (Annie) nee Wood. B. London, 1 Oct. 1847. Educated in
Evangelicalism by Miss Marryat, sister of novelist, but turned
to the High Church by reading Pusey and others. In "Holy Week"
of 1866 she resolved to write the story of the week from the
gospel. Their contradictions startled her but she regarded her doubts
as sin. In Dec. '67 she married the Rev. F. Besant, and read and
wrote extensively. The torment a child underwent in whooping-cough
caused doubts as to the goodness of God. A study of Greg's Creed
of Christendom and Arnold's Literature and Dogma increased her
scepticism. She became acquainted with the Rev. C. Voysey and Thomas
Scott, for whom she wrote an Essay on the Deity of Jesus of Nazareth,
"by the wife of a beneficed clergyman." This led to her husband
insisting on her taking communion or leaving. She chose the latter
course, taking by agreement her daughter with her. Thrown on her own
resources, she wrote further tracts for Mr. Scott, reprinted in My Path
to Atheism ('77). Joined the National Secular Society, and in '74 wrote
in the National Reformer over the signature of "Ajax." Next year she
took to the platform and being naturally eloquent soon won her way to
the front rank as a Freethought lecturess, and became joint editor
of the National Reformer. Some lectures on the French Revolution
were republished in book form. In April, '77, she was arrested
with Mr. Bradlaugh for publishing the Fruits of Philosophy. After a
brilliant defence, the jury exonerated the defendants from any corrupt
motives, and although they were sentenced the indictment was quashed
in Feb. '78, and the case was not renewed. In May, '78, a petition
in Chancery was presented to deprive Mrs. Besant of her child on the
ground of her Atheistic and Malthusian views. Sir G. Jessell granted
the petition. In '80 Mrs. Besant matriculated at the London University
and took 1st B.Sc. with honors in '82. She has debated much and issued
many pamphlets to be found in Theological Essays and Debates. She
wrote the second part of the Freethinkers' Text Book dealing with
Christian evidence; has written on the Sins of the Church, 1886, and
the Evolution of Society. She has translated Jules Soury's Religion
of Israel, and Jesus of the Gospels; Dr. L. Buechner on the Influence
of Heredity and Mind in Animals, and from the fifteenth edition of
Force and Matter. From '83 to '88 she edited Our Corner, and since
'85 has given much time to Socialist propaganda, and has written many
Socialist pamphlets. In Dec. '88, Mrs. Besant was elected a member
of the London School Board.

Vossius, b. Middleburg 1654. He took the degree of doctor of law and
became an advocate, but devoted himself to literature. He was at the
university of Oxford in 1672. His treatise on Original Sin, Peccatum
Originale (Eleutheropoli, 1678), in which he contends that the sin
of Adam and Eve was sexual inclination, caused a great outcry. It
was burnt, Beverland was imprisoned and his name struck from the
rolls of Leyden University. He wrote some other curious works and
died about 1712.

romancer. Balzac esteemed him highly. He died at Paris, 23 March,
1842. Prosper Merimee has published his correspondence. One of his

excuse is that he does not exist.

with a short introduction, a resume of C. B. Waite's History of the
Christian Religion, under the title of Whence come the Miracles of the
New Testament? This was the first attack upon dogmatic Christianity
published in Norway, and created much discussion. The following year
he published a translation of Colonel Ingersoll's article in the North
American Review upon the "Christian Religion," with a long preface,
in which he attacks the State Church and Monarchy. The translation

brutal treatment till the revolution of '48 set him at liberty. He
was soon again imprisoned. In '65 he wrote some remarkable articles
on Monotheism in Le Candide. After the revolution of 4 Sept. '70,
Blanqui demanded the suppression of worship. He was again imprisoned,
but was liberated and elected member of the Commune, and arrested by
Thiers. In his last imprisonment he wrote a curious book, Eternity

in the Eminent Women series.

Blount (Charles), English Deist of noble family, b. at Holloway 27
April, 1654. His father, Sir Henry Blount, probably shared in his

1678. This work Bishop Compton desired to see suppressed. In 1680 he
published Great is Diana of the Ephesians, or the Origin of Idolatry,
and the two first books of Apollonius Tyanius, with notes, in which
he attacks priestcraft and superstition. This work was condemned and
suppressed. Blount also published The Oracles of Reason, a number
of Freethought Essays. By his Vindication of Learning and Liberty
of the Press, and still more by his hoax on Bohun entitled William
and Mary Conquerors, he was largely instrumental in doing away with

which he seems to have believed, but in his Colloquium Heptaplomeron
coloquies of seven persons: a Catholic, a Lutheran, a Calvinist, a
Pagan, a Muhammadan, a Jew, and a Deist, which he left in manuscript,
he put some severe attacks on Christianity. Died of the plague at

the Trinity nor in the life to come, that he said the Virgin Mary
"was no more a virgin than my mother"; that he did not observe the
fasts of the Church, and that he spoke of the cardinals, monks,
and friars as hypocrites. It was in evidence that the Pope had said
"God may do the worst with me that he pleases in the future life; I
believe as every educated man does, the vulgar believe otherwise. We
have to speak as they do, but we must believe and think with the
few." Died 11 Oct. 1303.

libel. In his defence he ably asserted his right to hold and publish
his opinions. He read portions of the Bible in court to prove he was
justified in calling it obscene. Upon being sentenced, 27 May, 1822,
to eighteen months' imprisonment and to find sureties for five years,
he remarked "I have a mind, my lord, that can bear such a sentence
with fortitude."

Bradlaugh (Charles). Born East London, 26 Sept. 1833. Educated
in Bethnal Green and Hackney. He was turned from his Sunday-school
teachership and from his first situation through the influence of the
Rev. J. G. Packer, and found refuge with the widow of R. Carlile. In

London and became a solicitor's clerk. He began to write and lecture
under the nom de guerre of "Iconoclast," edited the Investigator, '59;
and had numerous debates with ministers and others. In 1860 he began
editing the National Reformer, which in '68-9 he successfully defended
against a prosecution of the Attorney General, who wished securities
against blasphemy. In '68 he began his efforts to enter Parliament,
and in 1880 was returned for Northampton. After a long struggle
with the House, which would not admit the Atheist, he at length took
his seat in 1885. He was four times re-elected, and the litigation
into which he was plunged will become as historic as that of John
Wilkes. Prosecuted in '76 for publishing The Fruits of Philosophy, he
succeeded in quashing the indictment. Mr. Bradlaugh has had numerous
debates, several of which are published. He has also written many
pamphlets, of which we mention New Lives of Abraham, David, and

dealing only with the Pentateuch. In 1882 he published Genesis, Its
Authorship and Authenticity. In Parliament Mr. Bradlaugh has become
a conspicuous figure, and has introduced many important measures. In
1888 he succeeded in passing an Oaths Bill, making affirmations
permissible instead of oaths. His elder daughter, Alice, b. 30
April, 1856, has written on Mind Considered as a Bodily Function,
1884. Died 2 Dec. 1888. His second daughter, Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner,

by The Education of the Feelings, of which there were several
editions. In 1836 he married Miss Hennell, sister of C. C. Hennell,
and took the System of Nature and Volney's Ruins of Empires "to
enliven the honeymoon." Among his friends was Mary Ann Evans ("George
Eliot"), who accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Bray to Italy. His works on
The Philosophy of Necessity (1841) and Cerebral Psychology (1875)
give the key to all his thought. He wrote a number of Thomas Scott's
series of tracts: Illusion and Delusion, The Reign of Law in Mind as
in Matter, Toleration with remarks on Professor Tyndall's "Address,"
and a little book, Christianity in the Light of our Present Knowledge
and Moral Sense (1876). He also wrote A Manual of Anthropology and
similar works. In a postscript to his last volume, Phases of Opinion
and Experience During a Long Life, dated 18 Sept. 1884, he stated

superstitions he showed he partook of others. This curious work
was followed by Hydriotaphia, or Urn-Burial, in which he treats
of cremation among the ancients. To this was added The Garden of
Cyrus. He died 19 Oct. 1682.

Bruno (Giordano), Freethought martyr, b. at Nola, near Naples, about
1548. He was christened Filippo which he changed to Filoteo, taking
the name of Giordano when he entered the Dominican order. Religious
doubts and bold strictures on the monks obliged him to quit Italy,
probably in 1580. He went to Geneva but soon found it no safe abiding
place, and quitted it for Paris, where he taught, but refused to attend
mass. In 1583 he visited England, living with the French ambassador
Castelnau. Having formed a friendship with Sir Philip Sidney, he
dedicated to him his Spaccio della Bestia Triomfante, a satire on all
mythologies. In 1585 he took part in a logical tournament, sustaining
the Copernican theory against the doctors of Oxford. The following year
he returned to Paris, where he again attacked the Aristotelians. He
then travelled to various cities in Germany, everywhere preaching
the broadest heresy. He published several Pantheistic, scientific and
philosophical works. He was however induced to return to Italy, and
arrested as an heresiarch and apostate at Venice, Sept. 1592. After
being confined for seven years by the Inquisitors, he was tried,
and burnt at Rome 17 Feb. 1600. At his last moments a crucifix was
offered him, which he nobly rejected. Bruno was vastly before his age
in his conception of the universe and his rejection of theological
dogmas. A statue of this heroic apostle of liberty and light, executed
by one of the first sculptors of Italy, is to be erected on the spot
where he perished, the Municipal Council of Rome having granted the
site in face of the bitterest opposition of the Catholic party. The
list of subscribers to this memorial comprises the principal advanced
thinkers in Europe and America.

Brzesky (Casimir Liszynsky Podsedek). See Liszinski.

Bucali or Busali (Leonardo), a Calabrian abbot of Spanish descent,
who became a follower of Servetus in the sixteenth century, and had
to seek among the Turks the safety denied him in Christendom. He died
at Damascus.

Buchanan (George), Scotch historian and scholar, b. Killearn,
Feb. 1506. Evincing an early love of study, he was sent to
Paris at the age of fourteen. He returned to Scotland and became
distinguished for his learning. James V. appointed him tutor to his
natural son. He composed his Franciscanus et Fratres, a satire on the
monks, which hastened the Scottish reformation. This exposed him to
the vengeance of the clergy. Not content with calling him Atheist,
Archbishop Beaton had him arrested and confined in St. Andrew's
Castle, from whence he escaped and fled to England. Here he found,
as he said, Henry VIII. burning men of opposite opinions at the same
stake for religion. He returned to Paris, but was again subjected to
the persecution of Beaton, the Scottish Ambassador. On the death of
a patron at Bordeaux, in 1548, he was seized by the Inquisition and
immured for a year and a half in a monastery, where he translated
the Psalms into Latin. He eventually returned to Scotland, where he
espoused the party of Moray. After a most active life, he died 28
Sept. 1582, leaving a History of Scotland, besides numerous poems,
satires, and political writings, the most important of which is a
work of republican tendency, De Jure Regni, the Rights of Kings.

Buchanan (Robert), Socialist, b. Ayr, 1813. He was successively a
schoolmaster, a Socialist missionary and a journalist. He settled in
Manchester, where he published works on the Religion of The Past and
Present, 1839; the Origin and Nature of Ghosts, 1840. An Exposure
of Joseph Barker, and a Concise History of Modern Priestcraft also
bear the latter date. At this time the Socialists were prosecuted for
lecturing on Sunday, and Buchanan was fined for refusing to take the
oath of supremacy, etc. After the decline of Owenism, he wrote for
the Northern Star, and edited the Glasgow Sentinel. He died at the
home of his son, the poet, at Bexhill, Sussex, 4 March, 1866.

Buchanan (Joseph Rhodes), American physician, b. Frankfort, Kentucky,
11 Dec. 1814. He graduated M.D. at Louisville University, 1842, and
has been the teacher of physiology at several colleges. From 1849-56
he published Buchanan's Journal of Man, and has written several works
on Anthropology.

Buchner (Ludwig). See Buechner.

Buckle (Henry Thomas), philosophical historian, b. Lee, Kent, 24
Nov. 1821. In consequence of his delicate health he was educated at
home. His mother was a strict Calvinist, his father a strong Tory,
but a visit to the Continent made him a Freethinker and Radical. He
ever afterwards held travelling to be the best education. It was his
ambition to write a History of Civilisation in England, but so vast was
his design that his three notable volumes with that title form only
part of the introduction. The first appeared in 1858, and created a
great sensation by its boldness. In the following year he championed
the cause of Pooley, who was condemned for blasphemy, and dared the
prosecution of infidels of standing. In 1861 he visited the East,
in the hope of improving his health, but died at Damascus, 29 May,
1862. Much of the material collected for his History has been published
in his Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works, edited by Helen Taylor,
1872. An abridged edition, edited by Grant Allen, appeared in 1886.

Buechner (Friedrich Karl Christian Ludwig), German materialist,
b. Darmstadt, 29 March, 1824. Studied medicine in Geissen, Strassburg
and Vienna. In '55 he startled the world with his bold work on
Force and Matter, which has gone through numerous editions and been
translated into nearly all the European languages. This work lost
him the place of professor which he held at Tuebingen, and he has
since practised in his native town. Buechner has developed his ideas
in many other works such as Nature and Spirit (1857), Physiological
Sketches, '61; Nature and Science, '62; Conferences on Darwinism,
'69; Man in the Past, Present and Future, '69; Materialism its History
and Influence on Society, '73; The Idea of God, '74; Mind in Animals,
'80; and Light and Life, '82. He also contributes to the Freidenker,
the Dageraad, and other journals.

Buffon (Georges Louis Leclerc), Count de, French naturalist,
b. Montford, Burgundy, 7 Sept. 1707. An incessant worker. His Natural
History in 36 volumes bears witness to the fertility of his mind
and his capacity for making science attractive. Buffon lived much in
seclusion, and attached himself to no sect or religion. Some of his
sentences were attacked by the Sorbonne. Herault de Sechelles says
that Buffon said: "I have named the Creator, but it is only necessary
to take out the word and substitute the power of nature." Died at
Paris 16 April, 1788.

Buitendijk or Buytendyck (Gosuinus van), Dutch Spinozist, who wrote an
Apology at the beginning of the eighteenth century and was banished
1716.

Bufalini (Maurizio), Italian doctor, b. Cesena 2 June, 1787. In 1813 he
published an essay on the Doctrine of Life in opposition to vitalism,
and henceforward his life was a conflict with the upholders of that
doctrine. He was accused of materialism, but became a professor at
Florence and a member of the Italian Senate in 1860. Died at Florence
31 March, 1875.

Burdach (Karl Friedrich), German physiologist, b. Leipsic 12 June,
1776. He occupied a chair at the University of Breslau. His works on
physiology and anthropology did much to popularise those sciences,
and the former is placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum for its
materialistic tendency. He died at Konigsberg, 16 July, 1847.

Burdon (William), M.A., writer, b. Newcastle, 11 Sept. 1764. Graduated
at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, 1788. He was intended for a clergyman,
but want of faith made him decline that profession. His principal work
is entitled Materials for Thinking. Colton largely availed himself of
this work in his Lacon. It went through five editions in his lifetime,
and portions were reprinted in the Library of Reason. He also addressed
Three Letters to the Bishop of Llandaff, wrote a Life and Character of
Bonaparte, translated an account of the Revolution in Spain, edited the
Memoirs of Count Boruwlaski, and wrote some objections to the annual
subscription to the Sons of the Clergy. Died in London, 30 May, 1818.

Burigny (Jean Levesque de), French writer, b. Rheims, 1692. He became
a member of the French Academy, wrote a treatise on the Authority
of the Pope, a History of Pagan Philosophy and other works, and
is credited with the Critical Examination of the Apologists of the
Christian Religion, published under the name of Freret by Naigeon,
1766. Levesque de Burigny wrote a letter in answer to Bergier's
Proofs of Christianity, which is published in Naigeon's Recueil
Philosophique. Died at Paris, 8 Oct. 1785.

Burmeister (Hermann), German naturalist, b. Stralsund, 15 Jan. 1807. In
1827 he became a doctor at Halle. In '48 he was elected to the National
Assembly. In 1850 he went to Brazil. His principal work is The History
of Creation, 1843.

Burmeister or Baurmeister (Johann Peter Theodor) a German Rationalist
and colleague of Ronge. Born at Flensburg, 1805. He resided in
Hamburg, and wrote in the middle of the present century under the
name of J. P. Lyser.

Burnet (Thomas), b. about 1635 at Croft, Yorkshire. Through the
interest of a pupil, the Duke of Ormonde, he obtained the mastership
of the Charterhouse, 1685. In 1681 the first part of his Telluris
Theoria Sacra, or Sacred Theory of the Earth, appeared in Latin, and
was translated and modified in 1684. In 1692 Burnet published, both
in English and in Latin, his Archaeologiae Philosophicae, or the Ancient
Doctrine of the Origin of Things. He professes in this to reconcile
his theory with Genesis, which receives a figurative interpretation;
and a ludicrous dialogue between Eve and the serpent gave great
offence. In a popular ballad Burnet is represented as saying--


                That all the books of Moses
                Were nothing but supposes.


He had to resign a position at court. In later life he wrote De Fide
et Officiis Christianorum (on Christian Faith and Duties), in which
he regards historical religions as based on the religion of nature,
and rejects original sin and the "magical" theory of sacraments;
and De Statu Mortuorum et Resurgentium, on the State of the Dead and
Resurrected, in which he opposed the doctrine of eternal punishment
and shadowed forth a scheme of Deism. These books he kept to himself
to avoid a prosecution for heresy, but had a few copies printed for
private friends. He died in the Charterhouse 27 Sept. 1715. A tract
entitled Hell Torments not Eternal was published in 1739.

Burnett (James), Lord Monboddo, a learned Scotch writer and judge,
was b. Monboddo, Oct. 1714. He adopted the law as his profession,
became a celebrated advocate, and was made a judge in 1767. His
work on the Origin and Progress of Language (published anonymously
1773-92), excited much derision by his studying man as one of the
animals and collecting facts about savage tribes to throw light on
civilisation. He first maintained that the orang-outang was allied
to the human species. He also wrote on Ancient Metaphysics. He was
a keen debater and discussed with Hume, Adam Smith, Robertson, and
Lord Kames. Died in Edinburgh, 26 May, 1799.

Burnouf (Emile Louis), French writer, b. Valonges, 25 Aug. 1821. He
became professor of ancient literature to the faculty of Nancy. Author
of many works, including a translation of selections from the Novum
Organum of Bacon, the Bhagvat-Gita, an Introduction to the Vedas,
a history of Greek Literature, Studies in Japanese, and articles
in the Revue des deux Mondes. His heresy is pronounced in his work
on the Science of Religions, 1878, in his Contemporary Catholicism,
and Life and Thought, 1886.

Burnouf (Eugene), French Orientalist, cousin of the preceding;
b. Paris, 12 Aug. 1801. He opened up to the Western world the Pali
language, and with it the treasures of Buddhism, whose essentially
Atheistic character he maintained. To him also we are largely indebted
for a knowledge of Zend and of the Avesta of the Zoroastrians. He
translated numerous Oriental works and wrote a valuable Introduction
to the History of Indian Buddhism. Died at Paris, 28 May, 1852.

Burns (Robert), Scotland's greatest poet, b. near Ayr, 25
Jan. 1759. His father was a small farmer, of enlightened views. The
life and works of Burns are known throughout the world. His
Freethought is evident from such productions as the "Holy Fair,"
"The Kirk's Alarm," and "Holy Willie's Prayer," and many passages in
private letters to his most familiar male friends. Died at Dumfries,
21 July, 1796.

Burr (William Henry), American author, b. 1819, Gloversville, N.Y.,
graduated at Union College, Schenectady, became a shorthand reporter
to the Senate. In 1869 he retired and devoted himself to literary
research. He is the anonymous author of Revelations of Antichrist, a
learned book which exposes the obscurity of the origin of Christianity,
and seeks to show that the historical Jesus lived almost a century
before the Christian era. He has also written several pamphlets:
Thomas Paine was Junius, 1880: Self Contradictions of the Bible;
Is the Bible a Lying Humbug? A Roman Catholic Canard, etc. He has
also frequently contributed to the Boston Investigator, the New York
Truthseeker, and the Ironclad Age of Indianapolis.

Burton (Sir Richard Francis), traveller, linguist, and author,
b. Barham House, Herts, 19 March, 1821. Intended for the Church,
he matriculated at Oxford, but in 1842 entered the East India
Company's service, served on the staff of Sir C. Napier, and soon
acquired reputation as an intrepid explorer. In '51 he returned to
England and started for Mecca and Medina, visiting those shrines
unsuspected, as a Moslem pilgrim. He was chief of the staff of the
Osmanli cavalry in the Crimean war, and has made many remarkable and
dangerous expeditions in unknown lands; he discovered and opened
the lake regions in Central Africa and explored the highlands of
Brazil. He has been consul at Fernando Po, Santos, Damascus, and
since 1872 at Trieste, and speaks over thirty languages. His latest
work is a new translation of The Thousand Nights and a Night in 10
vols. Being threatened with a prosecution, he intended justifying
"literal naturalism" from the Bible. Burton's knowledge of Arabic is
so perfect that when he used to read the tales to Arabs, they would
roll on the ground in fits of laughter.

Butler (Samuel), poet, b. in Strensham, Worcestershire, Feb. 1612. In
early life he came under the influence of Selden. He studied painting,
and is said to have painted a head of Cromwell from life. He became
clerk to Sir Samuel Luke, one of Cromwell's Generals, whom he has
satirised as Hudibras. This celebrated burlesque poem appeared in 1663
and became famous, but, although the king and court were charmed with
its wit, the author was allowed to remain in poverty and obscurity
till he died at Covent Garden, London, 25 Sept. 1680. Butler expressed
the opinion that


        "Religion is the interest of churches
        That sell in other worlds in this to purchase."


Buttmann (Philipp Karl), German philologist, b. Frankfort, 5
Dec. 1764. Became librarian of the Royal Library at Berlin. He edited
many of the Greek Classics, wrote on the Myth of the Deluge, 1819,
and a learned work on Mythology, 1828. Died Berlin, 21 June, 1829.

Buzot (Francois Leonard Nicolas), French Girondin, distinguished as
an ardent Republican and a friend and lover of Madame Roland. Born
at Evreux, 1 March, 1760; he died from starvation when hiding after
the suppression of his party June, 1793.

Byelinsky (Vissarion G.) See Belinsky.

Byron (George Gordon Noel) Lord, b. London, 22 Jan. 1788. He succeeded
his grand-uncle William in 1798; was sent to Harrow and Cambridge. In
1807 he published his Hours of Idleness, and awoke one morning to find
himself famous. His power was, however, first shown in his English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers, in which he satirised his critics, 1809. He
then travelled on the Continent, the result of which was seen in his
Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and other works. He married 2 Jan. 1815,
but a separation took place in the following year. Lord Byron then
resided in Italy, where he made the acquaintance of Shelley. In 1823
he devoted his name and fortune to the cause of the Greek revolution,
but was seized with fever and died at Missolonghi, 19 April, 1824. His
drama of Cain: a Mystery, 1822, is his most serious utterance,
and it shows a profound contempt for religious dogma. This feeling
is also exhibited in his magnificent burlesque poem, The Vision
of Judgment, which places him at the head of English satirists. In
his letters to the Rev. Francis Hodgson, 1811, he distinctly says:
"I do not believe in any revealed religion.... I will have nothing
to do with your immortality; we are miserable enough in this life,
without the absurdity of speculating upon another.... The basis of
your religion is injustice; the Son of God, the pure, the immaculate,
the innocent, is sacrificed for the guilty," etc.

Cabanis (Pierre Jean George), called by Lange "the father of the
materialistic physiology," b. Conac, 5 June, 1757. Became pupil
of Condillac and friend of Mirabeau, whom he attended in his last
illness, of which he published an account 1791. He was also intimate
with Turgot, Condorcet, Holbach, Diderot, and other distinguished
Freethinkers, and was elected member of the Institute and of the
Council of Five Hundred in the Revolution. His works are mostly
medical, the chief being Des Rapports du Physique et du Morale de
l'Homme, in which he contends that thoughts are a secretion of the
brain. Died Rueil, near Paris, 5 May, 1808.

Caesalpinus (Andreas), Italian philosopher of the Renaissance,
b. Arezzo, Tuscany, 1519. He became Professor of Botany at Pisa, and
Linnaeus admits his obligations to his work, De Plantis, 1583. He also
wrote works on metals and medicine, and showed acquaintance with the
circulation of the blood. In a work entitled Demonum Investigatio,
he contends that "possession" by devils is amenable to medical
treatment. His Quaestionum Peripateticarum, in five books, Geneva,
1568, was condemned as teaching a Pantheistic doctrine similar to
that of Spinoza. Bishop Parker denounced him. Died 23 Feb. 1603.

Caesar (Caius Julius), the "foremost man of all this world," equally
renowned as soldier, statesman, orator, and writer, b. 12 July,
100 B.C., of noble family. His life, the particulars of which are
well known, was an extraordinary display of versatility, energy,
courage, and magnanimity. He justified the well-known line of Pope,
"Caesar the world's great master and his own." His military talents
elevated him to the post of dictator, but this served to raise against
him a band of aristocratic conspirators, by whom he was assassinated,
15 March, 44 B.C. His Commentaries are a model of insight and clear
expression. Sallust relates that he questioned the existence of
a future state in the presence of the Roman senate. Froude says:
"His own writings contain nothing to indicate that he himself had any
religious belief at all. He saw no evidence that the gods practically
interfered in human affairs.... He held to the facts of this life and
to his own convictions; and as he found no reason for supposing that
there was a life beyond the grave he did not pretend to expect it."

Cahuac (John), bookseller, revised an edition of Palmer's Principles
of Nature, 1819. For this he was prosecuted at the instance of the
"Vice Society," but the matter was compromised. He was also prosecuted
for selling the Republican, 1820.

Calderino (Domizio), a learned writer of the Renaissance, b. in 1445,
in the territory of Verona, and lived at Rome, where he was professor
of literature, in 1477. He edited and commented upon many of the
Latin poets. Bayle says he was without religion. Died in 1478.

Calenzio (Eliseo), an Italian writer, b. in the kingdom of Naples about
1440. He was preceptor to Prince Frederic, the son of Ferdinand, the
King of Naples. He died in 1503, leaving behind a number of satires,
fables and epigrams, some of which are directed against the Church.

Call (Wathen Mark Wilks), English author, b. 7 June, 1817. Educated at
Cambridge, entered the ministry in 1843, but resigned his curacy about
1856 on account of his change of opinions, which he recounts in his
preface to Reverberations, 1876. Mr. Call is of the Positivist school,
and has contributed largely to the Fortnightly and Westminster Reviews.

Callet (Pierre Auguste), French politician, b. St. Etienne, 27
Oct. 1812; became editor of the Gazette of France till 1840. In 1848
he was nominated Republican representative. At the coup d'etat of 2
Dec. 1851, he took refuge in Belgium. He returned to France, but was
imprisoned for writing against the Empire. In 1871, Callet was again
elected representative for the department of the Loire. His chief
Freethought work is L'Enfer, an attack upon the Christian doctrine
of hell, 1861.

Camisani (Gregorio), Italian writer, b. at Venice, 1810. A Professor
of Languages in Milan. He has translated the Upas of Captain R. H. Dyas
and other works.

Campanella (Tommaso), Italian philosopher, b. Stilo, Calabria,
5 Sept. 1568. He entered the Dominican order, but was too much
attracted by the works of Telesio to please his superiors. In 1590
his Philosophia Sensibus Demonstratio was printed at Naples. Being
prosecuted, he fled to Rome, and thence to Florence, Venice,
and Padua. At Bologna some of his MS. fell into the hands of the
Inquisition, and he was arrested. He ably defended himself and was
acquitted. Returning to Calabria in 1599, he was arrested on charges
of heresy and conspiracy against the Spanish Government of Naples,
and having appealed to Rome, was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment
in the prison of the Holy Office. He was put to the torture seven
times, his torments on one occasion extending over forty hours, but
he refused to confess. He was dragged from one prison to another for
twenty-seven years, during which he wrote some sonnets, a history of
the Spanish monarchy, and several philosophical works. On 15 May,
1626, he was released by the intervention of Pope Urban VIII. He
was obliged to fly from Rome to France, where he met Gassendi. He
also visited Descartes in Holland. Julian Hibbert remarked that
his Atheismus Triumphatus--Atheism Subdued, 1631, would be better
entitled Atheismus Triumphans--Atheism Triumphant--as the author puts
his strongest arguments on the heterodox side. In his City of the Sun,
Campanella follows Plato and More in depicting an ideal republic and a
time when a new era of earthly felicity should begin. Hallam says "The
strength of Campanella's genius lay in his imagination." His "Sonnets"
have been translated by J. A. Symonds. Died Paris, 21 May, 1639.

Campbell (Alexander), Socialist of Glasgow, b. about the beginning
of the century. He early became a Socialist, and was manager at
the experiment at Orbiston under Abram Combe, of whom he wrote
a memoir. Upon the death of Combe, 1827, he became a Socialist
missionary in England. He took an active part in the co-operative
movement, and in the agitation for an unstamped press, for which he
was tried and imprisoned at Edinburgh, 1833-4. About 1849 he returned
to Glasgow and wrote on the Sentinel. In 1867 he was presented with
a testimonial and purse of 90 sovereigns by admirers of his exertions
in the cause of progress. Died about 1873.

Campion (William), a shoemaker, who became one of R. Carlile's
shopmen; tried 8 June, 1824, for selling Paine's Age of Reason. After
a spirited defence he was found guilty and sentenced to three years'
imprisonment. In prison he edited, in conjunction with J. Clarke,
E. Hassell, and T. R. Perry, the Newgate Monthly Magazine, to which
he contributed some thoughtful papers, from Sept. 1824, to Aug. 1826,
when he was removed to the Compter.

Canestrini (Giovanni), Italian naturalist, b. Rero, 1835. He studied
at Vienna, and in '60 was nominated Professor of Natural History at
Geneva. Signor Canestrini contributed to the Annuario Filosofico del
Libero Pensiero, and is known for his popularisation of the works
of Darwin, which he has translated into Italian. He has written
upon the Origin of Man, which has gone through two editions, Milan,
'66-'70, and on the Theory of Evolution, Turin, '77. He was appointed
Professor of Zoology, Anatomy and Comparative Physiology at Padua,
where he has published a Memoir of Charles Darwin, '82.

Cardano (Girolamo), better known as Jerome Cardan, Italian
mathematician, and physician, b. Pavia, 24 Sept. 1501. He studied
medicine, but was excluded from the Milan College of Physicians on
account of illegitimate birth. He and his young wife were at one time
compelled to take refuge in the workhouse. It is not strange that his
first work was an exposure of the fallacies of the faculty. A fortunate
cure brought him into notice and he journeyed to Scotland as the
medical adviser of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, 1551. In 1563 he was
arrested at Bologna for heresy, but was released, although deprived of
his professorship. He died at Rome, 20 Sept. 1576, having, it is said,
starved himself to verify his own prediction of his death. Despite
some superstition, Cardano did much to forward science, especially
by his work on Algebra, and in his works De Subtilitate Rerum and De
Varietate Rerum, amid much that is fanciful, perceived the universality
of natural law and the progressive evolution of life. Scaliger accused
him of Atheism. Puenjer says "Cardanus deserves to be named along with
Telesius as one of the principal founders of Natural Philosophy."

Carducci (Giosue), Italian poet and Professor of Italian Literature at
the University of Bologna, b. Pietrasantra, in the province of Lucca,
27 July, 1836. As early as '49 he cried, Abasso tutti i re! viva la
republica--Down with all kings! Long live the republic! Sprung into
fame by his Hymn to Satan, '69, by which he intended the spirit of
resistance. He has written many poems and satires in which he exhibits
himself an ardent Freethinker and Republican. At the end of '57 he
wrote his famous verse "Il secoletto vil che cristianeggia"--"This
vile christianising century." In '60 he became professor of Greek
in Bologna University, being suspended for a short while in '67 for
an address to Mazzini. In '76 he was elected as republican deputy to
the Italian Parliament for Lugo di Romagna.

Carlile (Eliza Sharples), second wife of Richard Carlile, came from
Lancashire during the imprisonment of Carlile and Taylor, 1831,
delivered discourses at the Rotunda, and started a journal, the Isis,
which lasted from 11 Feb. to 15 Dec. 1832. The Isis was dedicated
to the young women of England "until superstition is extinct,"
and contained Frances Wright's discourses, in addition to those
by Mrs. Carlile, who survived till '61. Mr. Bradlaugh lodged with
Mrs. Carlile at the Warner Place Institute, in 1849. She had three
children, Hypatia, Theophila and Julian, of whom the second is
still living.

Carlile (Jane), first wife of R. Carlile, who carried on his business
during his imprisonment, was proceeded against, and sentenced to two
years' imprisonment, 1821. She had three children, Richard, Alfred,
and Thomas Paine Carlile, the last of whom edited the Regenerator,
a Chartist paper published at Manchester, 1839.

Carlile (Richard), foremost among the brave upholders of an English
free press, b. Ashburton, Devon, 8 Dec. 1790. He was apprenticed to a
tin-plate worker, and followed that business till he was twenty-six,
when, having read the works of Paine, he began selling works like
Wooler's Black Dwarf, which Government endeavored to suppress. Sherwin
offered him the dangerous post of publisher of the Republican, which
he accepted. He then published Southey's Wat Tyler, reprinted the
political works of Paine and the parodies for which Hone was tried, but
which cost Carlile eighteen weeks' imprisonment. In 1818 he published
Paine's Theological Works. The prosecution instituted induced him to
go on printing similar works, such as Palmer's Principles of Nature,
Watson Refuted, Jehovah Unveiled, etc. By Oct. 1819, he had six
indictments to answer, on two of which he was tried from 12 to 16
October. He read the whole of the Age of Reason in his defence, in
order to have it in the report of the trial. He was found guilty and
sentenced (16 Nov.) to fifteen hundred pounds fine and three years'
imprisonment in Dorchester Gaol. During his imprisonment his business
was kept on by a succession of shopmen. Refusing to find securities
not to publish, he was kept in prison till 18 Nov. 1835, when he
was liberated unconditionally. During his imprisonment he edited
the Republican, which extended to fourteen volumes. He also edited
the Deist, the Moralist, the Lion (four volumes), the Prompter (for
No. 3 of which he again suffered thirty-two months' imprisonment),
and the Gauntlet. Amongst his writings are An Address to Men of
Science, The Gospel according to R. Carlile, What is God? Every

Carlyle (Thomas), one of the most gifted and original writers of the
century, b. 4 Dec. 1795, at Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire, where his
father, a man of intellect and piety, held a small farm. Showing early
ability he was intended for the Kirk, and educated at the University
of Edinburgh. He, however, became a tutor, and occupied his leisure
in translating from the German. He married Jane Welsh 17 Oct. 1826,
and wrote in the London Magazine and Edinburgh Review many masterly
critical articles, notably on Voltaire, Diderot, Burns, and German
literature. In 1833-4 his Sartor Resartus appeared in Fraser's
Magazine. In '34 he removed to London and began writing the French
Revolution, the MS. of the first vol. of which he confided to Mill,
with whom it was accidentally burnt. He re-wrote the work without
complaint, and it was published in '37. He then delivered a course
of lectures on "German Literature" and on "Heroes, Hero-Worship, and
the Heroic in History," in which he treats Mahomet as the prophet
"we are freest to speak of." His Past and Present was published in
'43. In '45 appeared Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches. In
'50 he published Latter-Day Pamphlets, which contains his most
distinctive political and social doctrines, and in the following year
his Life of John Sterling, in which his heresy clearly appears. His
largest work is his History of the Life and Times of Frederick the
Great, in 10 vols. He was elected rector of Edinburgh University in
'65. Died 5 Feb. 1881. Mr. Froude, in his Biography of Carlyle, says,
"We have seen him confessing to Irving that he did not believe as his
friend did in the Christian religion." ... "the special miraculous
occurrences of sacred history were not credible to him."

Carneades, sceptical philosopher, b. Cyrene about B.C. 213. He went
early to Athens, and attended the lectures of the Stoics, learning
logic from Diogenes. In the year 155, he was chosen with other
deputies to go to Rome to deprecate a fine which had been placed on
the Athenians. During his stay at Rome he attracted great attention
by his philosophical orations. Carneades attacked the very idea of
a God at once infinite and an individual. He denied providence and
design. Many of his arguments are preserved in Cicero's Academics
and De Natura Deorum. Carneades left no written works; his views
seem to have been systematised by his follower Clitomachus. He died
B.C. 129. Carneades is described as a man of unwearied industry. His
ethics were of elevated character.

Carneri (Bartholomaeus von), German writer, b. Trieste, 3

the revolution and was one of the most ardent orators of the Jacobin
club. In the National Assembly he voted for the death of Louis XVI.,
but was executed with the Girondins, 31 Oct. 1793. His Freethought
sentiments are evident from his System of Reason, 1773; his Spirit
of Morality and Philosophy, 1777; New Principles of Physic, 1782-3,
and other works.

escaped through some informality. He became secretary to Thierry,
edited the works of P. L. Courier, and established the Nation in
conjunction with Thiers and Mignet. J. S. Mill writes of him in terms
of high praise. The leading journalist of his time, his slashing
articles led to several duels, and in an encounter with Emile de
Girardin (22 July, 1836) he was fatally wounded. On his death-bed,
says M. Littre, he said "Point de pretres, point d'eglise"--no

Christendom." La Formula del Progresso contains a sketch of democratic
principles. On the outbreak of the revolution of '68 he advocated
a Federal Republic in a magnificent oration. The Crown was however
offered to Amadeus of Savoy. "Glass, with care," was Castelar's verdict
on the new dynasty, and in Feb. '73 Castelar drew up a Republican
Constitution; and for a year was Dictator of Spain. Upon his retirement
to France he wrote a sketchy History of the Republican Movement in
Europe. In '76 he returned to Spain and took part in the Cortes,
where he has continued to advocate Republican views. His Old Rome and

a friend of Lucian, who dedicated to him his treatise on the False
Prophet. He wrote an attack on Christianity, called The True Word. The
work was destroyed by the early Christians. The passages given by

popular orator at the club of the Cordeliers, and was associated with
Proudhomme in the journal Les Revolutions de Paris. Nominated member
of the Commune 10 Aug. 1792, he took the name of Anaxagoras to show
his little regard for his baptismal saints. He was elected Procureur

took part in the legal defence of Louis XVI., eulogised Charlotte
Corday, and gave further offence by some letters in the Journal de
Paris. He was committed to prison, and here met his ideal in the
Comtesse de Coigny. Confined in the same prison, to her he addressed
the touching verses, The Young Captive (La jeune Captive). He was
executed 25 July, 1794, leaving behind, among other poems, an imitation
of Lucretius, entitled Hermes, which warrants the affirmation of de
Chenedolle, that "Andre Chenier etait athee avec delices."

Chenier (Marie Joseph de), French poet and miscellaneous writer,
brother of the preceding, b. Constantinople, 28 Aug. 1764. He served
two years in the army, and then applied himself to literature. His

dining in Charterhouse and remarked, not knowing the author, "'twas no
matter if all the copies were burnt and the author with them, because
it made every man's private fancy judge of religion." Clifford died 10
Dec. 1677. In the Nouvelle Biographie Generale Clifford is amusingly
described as an "English theologian of the order des Chartreux," who,
it is added, was "prior of his order."

an anagram of Bergier, whose Certainty of the Proofs of Christianity
he parodies. He travelled widely, but became a resident of Paris
and a warm partisan of the Revolution, to which he devoted his large
fortune. He wrote a reply to Burke, and continually wrote and spoke
in favor of a Universal Republic. On 19 June, 1790, he, at the head
of men of all countries, asked a place at the feast of Federation,
and henceforward was styled "orator of the human race." He was, with
Paine, Priestley, Washington and Klopstock, made a French citizen,
and in 1792 was elected to the Convention by two departments. He
debaptised himself, taking the name Anacharsis, was a prime mover
in the Anti-Catholic party, and induced Bishop Gobel to resign. He
declared there was no other God but Nature. Incurring the enmity of
Robespierre, he and Paine were arrested as foreigners. After two
and a half months' imprisonment at St. Lazare, he was brought to
the scaffold with the Hebertistes, 24 March, 1794. He died calmly,
uttering materialist sentiments to the last.

Clough (Arthur Hugh), poet, b. Liverpool, 1 Jan. 1819. He was
educated at Rugby, under Dr. Arnold, and at Oxford, where he showed
himself of the Broad School. Leslie Stephen says, "He never became
bitter against the Church of his childhood, but he came to regard its
dogmas as imperfect and untenable." In '48 he visited Paris, and the
same year produced his Bothie of Toper-na-Fuosich: a Long-Vacation
Pastoral. Between '49 and '52 he was professor of English literature
in London University. In '52 he visited the United States, where
he gained the friendship of Emerson and Longfellow, and revised
the Dryden translation of Plutarch's Lives. Died at Florence, 13
Nov. 1861. His Remains are published in two volumes, and include
an essay on Religious Tradition and some notable poems. He is the
Thyrsis of Matthew Arnold's exquisite Monody.

Cnuzius (Matthias). See Knutzen.

Coke (Henry), author of Creeds of the Day, or collated opinions of
reputable thinkers, in 2 vols, London, 1883.

Cole (Peter), a tanner of Ipswich, was burnt for blasphemy in the
castle ditch, Norwich, 1587. A Dr. Beamond preached to him before the
mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, "but he would not recant." See Hamont.

Colenso (John William), b. 24 Jan. 1814. Was educated at St. John's,
Cambridge, and became a master at Harrow. After acquiring fame by his
valuable Treatise on Algebra, '49, he became first Bishop of Natal,
'54. Besides other works, he published The Pentateuch and Book of
Joshua Critically Examined, 1862-79, which made a great stir, and
was condemned by both Houses of Convocation and its author declared
deposed. The Privy Council, March '65, declared this deposition
"null and void in law." Colenso pleaded the cause of the natives at
the time of the Zulu War. He died 20 June, 1883.

Colins (Jean Guillaume Cesar Alexandre Hippolyte) Baron de,
Belgian Socialist and founder of "Collectivism," b. Brussels, 24
Dec. 1783. Author of nineteen volumes on Social Science. He denied
alike Monotheism and Pantheism, but taught the natural immortality of
the soul. Died at Paris, 12 Nov. 1859. A number of disciples propagate
his opinions in the Philosophie de l'Avenir.

Collins (Anthony), English Deist, b. Heston, Middlesex, 21 June,
1676. He studied at Cambridge and afterwards at the Temple, and
became Justice of the Peace and Treasurer of the County of Essex. He
was an intimate friend of Locke, who highly esteemed him and made
him his executor. He wrote an Essay on Reason, 1707; Priestcraft
in Perfection, 1710; a Vindication of the Divine Attributes, and a
Discourse on Freethinking, 1713. This last occasioned a great outcry,
as it argued that all belief must be based on free inquiry, and
that the use of reason would involve the abandonment of supernatural
revelation. In 1719 he published An Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty,
a brief, pithy defence of necessitarianism, and in 1729 A Discourse
on Liberty and Necessity. In 1724 appeared his Discourse on the
Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion, and this was followed
by The Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered, 1726. He was a skilful
disputant, and wrote with great ability. He is also credited with A
Discourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing. Died at London,
13 Dec. 1729. Collins, says Mr. Leslie Stephen, "appears to have been
an amiable and upright man, and to have made all readers welcome to
the use of a free library." Professor Fraser calls him "a remarkable
man," praises his "love of truth and moral courage," and allows that in
answering Dr. Samuel Clarke on the question of liberty and necessity
he "states the arguments against human freedom with a logical force
unsurpassed by any necessitarian." A similar testimony to Collins as
a thinker and dialectician is borne by Professor Huxley.

Colman (Lucy N.), American reformer, b. 26 July, 1817, has spent
most of her life advocating the abolition of slavery, women's rights,
and Freethought. She has lectured widely, written Reminisences in the
Life of a Reformer of Fifty Years, and contributed to the Truthseeker

15 Jan. 1785. He traded as a tanner, but, becoming acquainted with
Robert Owen, founded a community at Orbiston upon the principle of

to the scheme. But his health gave way and he died 11 Aug. 1827. He
wrote Metaphysical Sketches of the Old and New Systems and other
works advocating Owenism.

Combe (Andrew), physician, brother of the above, b. Edinburgh,
27 Oct. 1797; studied there and in Paris; aided his brother George

which excited great controversy especially for removing the chimeras of
special providence and efficacy of prayer. In '33 he married a daughter
of Mrs. Siddons. He visited the United States and lectured on Moral
Philosophy and Secular Education. His last work was The Relations
between Science and Religion, '57, in which he continued to uphold
Secular Theism. He also published many lectures and essays. Among his
friends were Miss Evans (George Eliot), who spent a fortnight with him
in '52. He did more than any man of his time, save Robert Owen, for the
cause of Secular education. Died at Moor Park, Surrey, 14 Aug. 1858.

Comparetti (Domenico), Italian philologist, b. Rome in 1835. Signor
Comparetti is Professor at the Institute of Superior Studies, Rome,
and has written many works on the classic writers, in which he evinces
his Pagan partialities.

Comte (Isidore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier), French philosopher,
mathematician and reformer, b. at Montpelier, 12 Jan. 1798. Educated at
Paris in the Polytechnic School, where he distinguished himself by his
mathematical talent. In 1817 he made the acquaintance of St. Simon,
agreeing with him as to the necessity of a Social renovation based
upon a mental revolution. On the death of St. Simon ('25) Comte
devoted himself to the elaboration of an original system of scientific
thought, which, in the opinion of some able judges, entitles him to
be called the Bacon of the nineteenth century. Mill speaks of him as
the superior of Descartes and Leibniz. In '25 he married, but the
union proved unhappy. In the following year he lectured, but broke
down under an attack of brain fever, which occasioned his detention
in an asylum. He speedily recovered, and in '28 resumed his lectures,
which were attended by men like Humboldt, Ducrotay, Broussais, Carnot,
etc. In '30 he put forward the first volumes of his Course of Positive
Philosophy, which in '42 was completed by the publication of the sixth
volume. A condensed English version of this work was made by Harriet
Martineau, '53. In '45 Comte formed a passionate Platonic attachement
to Mme. Clotilde de Vaux, who died in the following year, having
profoundely influenced Comte's life. In consequence of his opinions,
he lost his professorship, and was supported by his disciples--Mill,
Molesworth and Grote, in England, assisting. Among other works, Comte
published A General View of Positivism, '48, translated by Dr. Bridges,
'65; A System of Positive Polity, '51, translated by Drs. Bridges,
Beesley, F. Harrison, etc., '75-79; and A Positive Catechism, '54,
translated by Dr. Congreve, '58. He also wrote on Positive Logic,
which he intended to follow with Positive Morality and Positive
Industrialism. Comte was a profound and suggestive thinker. He
resolutely sets aside all theology and metaphysics, coordinates
the sciences and substitutes the service of man for the worship of
God. Mr. J. Cotter Morison says "He belonged to that small class
of rare minds, whose errors are often more valuable and stimulating
than other men's truths." He died of cancer in the stomach at Paris,
5 Sept. 1857.

Condillac (Etienne Bonnot de), French philosopher, b. Grenoble,
about 1715. His life was very retired, but his works show much
acuteness. They are in 23 vols., the principal being A Treatise on the
Sensations, 1764; A Treatise on Animals, and An Essay on the Origin
of Human Knowledge. In the first-named he shows that all mental life
is gradually built up out of simple sensations. Died 3 Aug. 1780.

Condorcet (Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de),
French philosopher and politician, b. Ribemont, Picardy, 17
Sept. 1743. Dedicated to the Virgin by a pious mother, he was kept

he soon gave up religion. At sixteen he maintained a mathematical
thesis in the presence of Alembert. In the next year he dedicated
to Turgot a Profession of Faith. After some mathematical works, he
was made member of the Academy, of which he was appointed perpetual
secretary, 1773. In 1776 he published his atheistic Letters of a
Theologian. He also wrote biographies of Turgot and Voltaire, and
in favor of American independence and against negro slavery. In
1791 he represented Paris in the National Assembly, of which he
became Secretary. It was on his motion that, in the following year,
all orders of nobility were abolished. Voting against the death of
the king and siding with the Gironde drew on him the vengeance of
the extreme party. He took shelter with Madame Vernet, but fearing to
bring into trouble her and his wife, at whose instigation he wrote his
fine Sketch of the Progress of the Human Mind while in hiding, he left,
but, being arrested, died of exhaustion or by poison self-administered,
at Bourg la Reine, 27 March, 1794.

Condorcet (Sophie de Grouchy Caritat, Marquise de), wife of above,
and sister of General Grouchy and of Mme. Cabanis, b. 1765. She
married Condorcet 1786, and was considered one of the most beautiful
women of her time. She shared her husband's sentiments and opinions
and, while he was proscribed, supported herself by portrait
painting. She was arrested, and only came out of prison after the
fall of Robespierre. She translated Adam Smith's Theory of the Moral
Sentiments, which she accompanied with eight letters on Sympathy,
addressed to Cabanis. She died 8 Sept. 1822. Her only daughter married
Gen. Arthur O'Connor.

Chinese sage, b. in the State of Loo, now part of Shantung, about
B.C. 551. He was distinguished by filial piety and learning. In his
nineteenth year he married, and three years after began as a teacher,
rejecting none who came to him. He travelled through many states. When
past middle age he was appointed chief minister of Loo, but finding
the Duke desired the renown of his name without adopting his counsel,
he retired, and devoted his old age to editing the sacred classics
of China. He died about B.C. 478. His teaching, chiefly found in the
Lun-Yu, or Confucian Analects, was of a practical moral character,
and did not include any religious dogmas.

on Roman Polytheism and an important work on Religion Considered in
its Source, its Forms and its Developments (6 vols.; 1824-32). Died

sceptic, and has been called a second Voltaire. A son was executor
to Auguste Comte.

Conta (Basil), Roumanian philosopher, b. Neamtza 27 Nov. 1845. Studied

declined to subscribe the articles. Graduated at Dublin in '66, and
took LL.D. in '75. In '77 he became editor of the Dublin University
Magazine, in which appeared some studies of the lineage of Christian
doctrine and traditions afterwards published under the title of The

July, 1886.

Cooper (Anthony Ashley), see Shaftesbury.

Cooper (Henry), barrister, b. Norwich about 1784. He was a schoolfellow
of Wm. Taylor of Norwich. He served as midshipman at the battle of the
Nile, but disliking the service became a barrister, and acquired some
fame by his spirited defence of Mary Ann Carlile, 21 July, 1821, for
which the report of the trial was dedicated to him by R. Carlile. He
was a friend of Lord Erskine, whose biography he commenced. Died 19
Sept. 1824.

at Barton-on-Irwell, near Manchester. He had the advantage of being
brought up in a Freethought family. At fourteen he became teacher
in the Co-operative Schools, Salford, lectured at fifteen, and
by seventeen became an acknowledged advocate of Owenism, holding a
public discussion with the Rev. J. Bromley. Some of his lectures were
published--one on Original Sin sold twelve thousand copies--when he was
scarcely eighteen. The Holy Scriptures Analysed (1832) was denounced
by the Bishop of Exeter in the House of Lords. Cooper was dismissed
from a situation he had held ten years, and in 1841 became a Socialist
missionary in the North of England and Scotland. At Edinburgh (1845)
he wrote Free Agency and Orthodoxy, and compiled the Infidel's Text
Book. About '50 he came to London, lecturing with success at John
Street Institution. In '54 he started the London Investigator, which
he edited for three years. In it appears his lectures on "Science
v. Theology," "Admissions of Distinguished Men," etc. Failing health
obliged him to retire leaving the Investigator to "Anthony Collins"
(W. H. Johnson), and afterwards to "Iconoclast" (C. Bradlaugh). At
his last lecture he fainted on the platform. In 1858 he remodelled
his Infidel Text-Book into a work on The Bible and Its Evidences. He
devoted himself to political reform until his death, 3 May, 1868.

"Whether Deity be a Free Agent," etc., 1789. Deputed with James
Watt, the inventor, by the Constitutional clubs to congratulate
the Democrats of France (April, 1792), he was attacked by Burke
and replied in a vigorous pamphlet. In '94 he published Information
Concerning America, and in the next year followed his friend Priestly
to Philadelphia, established himself as a lawyer and was made judge. He
also conducted the Emporium of Arts and Sciences in that city. He was
Professor of Medicine at Carlisle College, '12, and afterwards held
the chairs both of Chemistry and Political Economy in South Carolina
College, of which he became President, 1820-34. This position he was
forced to resign on account of his religious views. He translated
from Justinian and Broussais, and digested the Statutes of South
Carolina. In philosophy a Materialist, in religion a Freethinker,
in politics a Democrat, he urged his views in many pamphlets. One on
The Right of Free Discussion, and a little book on Geology and the
Pentateuch, in reply to Prof. Silliman, were republished in London
by James Watson. Died at Columbia, 11 May, 1840. [1]

[1] So varied was the activity of T. Cooper during his long life that
his works in the British Museum were catalogued as by six different
persons of the same name. I pointed this out, and the six single
gentlemen will be rolled into one.

Coornhert (Dirk Volkertszoon), Dutch humanist, poet and writer,
b. Amsterdam, 1522. He travelled in his youth through Spain
and Portugal. He set up as an engraver at Haarlem, and became
thereafter notary and secretary of the city of Haarlem. He had a
profound horror of intolerance, and defended liberty against Beza and

Satan, etc. Bayle, who writes of him as Theodore Koornhert, says he
communed neither with Protestants nor Catholics. The magistrates of
Delft drove him out of their city. He translated Cicero's De Officiis,

the army and became an officer of artillery, serving with distinction
in the Army of the Republic. He wrote many pamphlets, directed against

Rugby and Oxford, where he took B.C.L. in 1849. Entered the Church,
but has devoted himself to history and mythology. His most pretentious
work is Mythology of the Aryan Nations (1870). He has also written
an Introduction to Comparative Mythology and several historical
works. In 1886 he became Bishop of Bloemfontein. He is credited with
the authorship of the English Life of Jesus, published under the name

at Liscard, Cheshire. He also was professor at the Ladies' College,
Liverpool, some of his lectures there being published '57. In Jan. '65,
he went to Albany Church, Edinburgh, but his views being too broad
for that congregation, he left in Feb. '67 but continued to give
Sunday lectures until his death, 6 June, 1869. In '66 he published
Credibilia: an Inquiry into the grounds of Christian faith and two
years later The Founders of Christianity, discourses on the origin of

Cremonini (Cesare), Italian philosopher, b. Cento, Ferrara, 1550, was
professor of philosophy at Padua from 1591 to 1631, when he died. A
follower of Aristotle, he excited suspicion by his want of religion and
his teaching the mortality of the soul. He was frequently ordered by
the Jesuits and the Inquisition to refute the errors he gave currency
to, but he was protected by the Venetian State, and refused. Like most
of the philosophers of his time, he distinguished between religious
and philosophic truth. Bayle says. "Il a passe pour un esprit fort,
qui ne croyait point l'immortalite de l'ame." Larousse says, "On peut
dire qu'il n'etait pas chretien." Ladvocat says his works "contain
many things contrary to religion."

the great problems of religion and civilisation. He took his diploma
from the London College of Physicians in '73. In '77 he wrote his first
essay, "God or Force," which, being rejected by all the magazines, he
published as a pamphlet. Other essays on the Constitution of the World,
Carlyle, Emerson, and Spencer being also rejected, he published them in
a book entitled The Religion of the Future, '80, which fell flat. He
then started his work Civilisation and Progress, which appeared in
'85, and was also unsuccessful until republished with a few notices
in '87, when it received a chorus of applause, for its clear and
original thoughts. Mr. Crozier is now engaged on his Autobiography,
after which he proposes to deal with the Social question.

Cuffeler (Abraham Johann), a Dutch philosopher and doctor of law,
who was one of the first partizans of Spinoza. He lived at Utrecht
towards the end of the seventeenth century, and wrote a work on
logic in three parts entitled Specimen Artis Ratiocinandi, etc.,
published ostensibly at Hamburg, but really at Amsterdam or Utrecht,
1684. It was without name but with the author's portrait.

Cuper (Frans), Dutch writer, b. Rotterdam. Cuper is suspected to have
been one of those followers of Spinoza, who under pretence of refuting
him, set forth and sustained his arguments by feeble opposition. His
work entitled Arcana Atheismi Revelata, Rotterdam 1676, was denounced
as written in bad faith. Cuper maintained that the existence of God
could not be proved by the light of reason.

Cyrano de Bergerac (Savinien), French comic writer, b. Paris 6 March,
1619. After finishing his studies and serving in the army in his youth
he devoted himself to literature. His tragedy "Agrippine" is full of
what a bookseller called "belles impietes," and La Monnoye relates that
at its performance the pit shouted "Oh, the wretch! The Atheist! How
he mocks at holy things!" Cyrano knew personally Campanella, Gassendi,
Lamothe Le Vayer, Liniere, Rohault, etc. His other works consist of
a short fragment on Physic, a collection of Letters, and a Comic
History of the States and Empires of the Moon and the Sun. Cyrano
took the idea of this book from F. Godwin's Man in the Moon, 1583,
and it in turn gave rise to Swift's Gulliver's Travels and Voltaire's
Micromegas. Died Paris, 1655.

Czolbe (Heinrich), German Materialist, b. near Dantzic, 30 Dec. 1819,
studied medicine at Berlin, writing an inaugural dissertation on

Knowledge. He was an intimate friend of Ueberweg. Died at Koenigsberg,
19 Feb. 1873. Lange says "his life was marked by a deep and genuine
morality."

D'Ablaing. See Giessenburg.

Dale (Antonius van), Dutch writer, b. Haarlem, 8 Nov. 1638. His work
on oracles was erudite but lumbersome, and to it Fontenelle gave the
charm of style. It was translated into English by Mrs. Aphra Behn,
under the title of The History of Oracles and the Cheats of Pagan
Priests, 1699. Van Dale, in another work on The Origin and Progress
of Idolatry and Superstition, applied the historical method to his
subject, and showed that the belief in demons was as old and as
extensive as the human race. He died at Haarlem, 28 Nov. 1708.

Damilaville (Etienne Noel), French writer, b. at Bordeaux, 1721. At
first a soldier, then a clerk, he did some service for Voltaire, who
became his friend. He also made the friendship Diderot, d'Alembert,
Grimm, and d'Holbach. He contributed to the Encyclopedie, and in
1767 published an attack on the theologians, entitled Theological
Honesty. The book entitled Christianity Unveiled [see Boulanger and
Holbach] was attributed by Voltaire, who called it Impiety Unveiled,
and by La Harpe and Lalande to Damilaville. Voltaire called him
"one of our most learned writers." Larousse says "he was an ardent
enemy of Christianity." He has also been credited with a share in
the System of Nature. Died 15 Dec. 1768.

Dandolo (Vincenzo) Count, Italian chemist, b. Venice, 26 Oct. 1758,
wrote Principles of Physical Chemistry, a work in French on The New
Men, in which he shows his antagonism to religion, and many useful
works on vine, timber, and silk culture. Died Varessa, 13 Dec. 1819.

Danton (Georges Jacques), French revolutionist, b. Arcis sur Aube, 28
Oct. 1759. An uncle wished him to enter into orders, but he preferred
to study law. During the Revolution his eloquence made him conspicuous
at the Club of Cordeliers, and in Feb. 1791, he became one of the
administrators of Paris. One of the first to see that after the flight
of Louis XVI. he could no longer be king, he demanded his suspension,
and became one of the chief organisers of the Republic. In the alarm
caused by the invasion he urged a bold and resolute policy. He was a
member of the Convention and of the Committee of Public Safety. At the
crisis of the struggle with Robespierre, Danton declined to strike
the first blow and disdained to fly. Arrested March, 1794, he said
when interrogated by the judge, "My name is Danton, my dwelling will
soon be in annihilation; but my name will live in the Pantheon of
history." He maintained his lofty bearing on the scaffold, where he
perished 5 April, 1794. For his known scepticism Danton was called
fils de Diderot. Carlyle calls him "a very Man."

geography, on which he produced important works. He had no religion
and was suspected of Atheism. He travelled through Syria, Babylonia,
etc., in 1650. He translated Herodotus (1664) and the orations of

12 Feb. 1809. Educated at Shrewsbury, Edinburgh University, and

natural objects. He was intended for a clergyman, but, incited by
Humboldt's Personal Narrative, resolved to travel. He accompanied
Captain Fitzroy in the "Beagle" on a voyage of exploration, '31-36,
which he narrated in his Voyage of a Naturalist Round the World, which
obtained great popularity. In '39 he married, and in '42 left London
and settled at Down, Kent. His studies, combined with the reading of
Lamarck and Malthus, led to his great work on The Origin of Species
by means of Natural Selection, '59, which made a great outcry and
marked an epoch. Darwin took no part in the controversy raised by the
theologians, but followed his work with The Fertilisation of Orchids,
'62; Cross and Self Fertilisation of Plants, '67; Variations of
Plants and Animals under Domestication, '65; and in '71 The Descent
of Man and Selection in relation to Sex, which caused yet greater
consternation in orthodox circles. The following year he issued The
Expression of the Emotions of Men and Animals. He also published
works on the Movements of Plants, Insectivorous Plants, the Forms of
Flowers, and Earthworms. He died 19 April, 1882, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey, despite his expressed unbelief in revelation. To
a German student he wrote, in '79, "Science has nothing to do with
Christ, except in so far as the habit of scientific research makes
a man cautious in admitting evidence. For myself I do not believe
that there ever has been any revelation." In his Life and Letters
he relates that between 1836 and 1842 he had come to see "that the
Old Testament was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the
Hindoos." He rejected design and said "I for one must be content to
remain an Agnostic."

Laridon-Duplessis. He edited Le Vieux Cordelier and the Revolutions
de France et de Brabant, in which he stated that Mohammedanism was
as credible as Christianity. He was a Deist, preferring Paganism to
Christianity. Both creeds were more or less unreasonable; but, folly
for folly, he said, I prefer Hercules slaying the Erymanthean boar
to Jesus of Nazareth drowning two thousand pigs. He was executed
with Danton, 5 April 1794. His amiable wife, Lucile, who was an
Atheist (b. 1770), in a few days shared his fate (April 13). Carlyle

wit--nay, humor."

he defended Clement Marot when persecuted for making a French version
of the Psalms. He wrote the Cymbalum Mundi, a satire upon religion,
published under the name of Thomas de Clenier a Pierre Tryocan,
i.e., Thomas Incredule a Pierre Croyant, 1537. It was suppressed
and the printer, Jehan Morin, imprisoned. Des Periers fled and
died (probably by suicide, to escape persecution) 1544. An English

famous Atheistic treatise, The Three Impostors.

his early years he was "for whole days without food." Self-educated,
he established the first Mechanics' Institute in England at Hulme,
gave Sunday scientific lectures, and published several discourses
in favor of secular education. He became secretary of the National
Political Union. He was a Deist. Like Bentham, who became his friend,
he bequeathed his body for scientific purposes. Died in London,
23 Nov. 1834.

Deubler (Konrad). The son of poor parents, b. Goisern, near Ischl,
Upper Austria, 26 Nov. 1814. Self-taught amid difficulties,
he became the friend of Feuerbach and Strauss, and was known as
"the Peasant Philosopher." In 1854 he was indicted for blasphemy,
and was sentenced to two years' hard labor and imprisonment during
pleasure. He was incarcerated from 7 Dec. '54, till Nov. '56 at Bruenn,
and afterwards at Olmutz, where he was released 24 March, 1857. He
returned to his native place, and was visited by Feuerbach. In '70
he was made Burgomaster by his fellow-townsmen. Died 30 March, 1884.

Deurhoff (Willem), Dutch writer, b. Amsterdam, March 1650. Educated
for the Church, he gave himself to philosophy, translated the works of
Descartes, and was accused of being a follower of Spinoza. Forced to
leave his country, he took refuge in Brabant, but returned to Holland,
where he died 10 Oct. 1717. He left some followers.

De Wette. (See Wette M. L. de).

D'Holbach. See Holbach (P. H. D. von), Baron.

Diagoras, Greek poet, philosopher, and orator, known as "the Atheist,"
b. Melos. A pupil of Democritus, who is said to have freed him from
slavery. A doubtful tradition reports that he became an Atheist after
being the victim of an unpunished perjury. He was accused (B.C. 411)
of impiety, and had to fly from Athens to Corinth, where he died. A
price was put upon the Atheist's head. His works are not extant,
but several anecdotes are related of him, as that he threw a wooden
statue of Hercules into the fire to cook a dish of lentils, saying the
god had a thirteenth task to perform; and that, being on his flight
by sea overtaken by a storm, hearing his fellow-passengers say it
was because an Atheist was on board, he pointed to other vessels
struggling in the same storm without being laden with a Diagoras.

Di Cagno Politi (Niccola Annibale), Italian Positivist, b. Bari,
1857. Studied at Naples under Angiulli, has written on modern culture
and on experimental philosophy in Italy, and contributed articles on
Positivism to the Rivista Europea.

Diderot (Denis), French philosopher, b. Langres, 6 Oct. 1713. His
father, a cutler, intended him for the Church. Educated by Jesuits,
at the age of twelve he received the tonsure. He had a passion for
books, but, instead of becoming a Jesuit, went to Paris, where he
supported himself by teaching and translating. In 1746 he published
Philosophic Thoughts, which was condemned to be burnt. It did much
to advance freedom of opinion. Three years later his Letters on the
Blind occasioned his imprisonment at Vincennes for its materialistic
Atheism. Rousseau, who called him "a transcendent genius," visited
Diderot in prison, where he remained three years. Diderot projected the
famous Encyclopedie, which he edited with Alembert, and he contributed
some of the most important articles. With very inadequate recompense,
and amidst difficulties that would have appalled an ordinary editor,
Diderot superintended the undertaking for many years (1751-65). He also
contributed to other important works, such as Raynal's Philosophic
History, L'Esprit, by Helvetius, and The System of Nature and other
works of his friend D'Holbach. Diderot's fertile mind also produced
dramas, essays, sketches, and novels. Died 30 July, 1784. Comte calls
Diderot "the greatest thinker of the eighteenth century."

Dinter (Gustav Friedrich), German educationalist, b. Borna, near
Leipsic, 29 Feb. 1760. His Bible for Schoolmasters is his best-known

books, and excited much controversy. Died at Konigsberg, 29 May, 1831.

Dippel (Johann Konrad), German alchemist and physician, b. 10
Aug. 1672, at Frankenstein, near Darmstadt. His Papismus vapulans
Protestantium (1698) drew on him the wrath of the theologians of
Giessen, and he had to flee for his life. Attempting to find out the
philosopher's stone, he discovered Prussian blue. In 1705 he published
his satires against the Protestant Church, Hirt und eine Heerde,
under the name of Christianus Democritos. He denied the inspiration
of the Bible, and after an adventurous life in many countries died
25 April, 1734.

(1886), and has just published Moses or Darwin? a School Question,
1889. Dr. Dodel-Port is an hon. member of the London Royal Society
and Vice-President of the German Freethinkers' Union.

b. Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, about the beginning of the eighteenth
century. He was educated at Magdalen Hall, when he proceeded B.A.,
9 Feb. 1726. In '42 he published a pamphlet entitled Christianity
not Founded on Argument, which in a tone of grave irony contends that
Christianity can only be accepted by faith. He was brought up to the
law and was a zealous friend of the Society for the Promotion of Arts,
Manufactures, and Commerce. Died 1784.

Doebereiner (Johann Wolfgang), German chemist, b. Bavaria, 15

Dolet (Etienne), a learned French humanist, b. Orleans 3 Aug. 1509. He
studied in Paris, Padua and Venice. For his heresy he had to fly
from Toulouse and lived for some time at Lyons, where he established
a printing-press and published some of his works, for which he was
imprisoned. He was acquainted with Rabelais, Des Periers, and other
advanced men of the time. In 1543 the Parliament condemned his books
to be burnt, and in the next year he was arrested on a charge of
Atheism. After being kept two years in prison he was strangled and
burnt, 3 Aug. 1546. It is related that seeing the sorrow of the crowd,
he said: "Non dolet ipe Dolet, sed pia turba dolet."--Dolet grieves
not, but the generous crowd grieves. His goods being confiscated,
his widow and children were left to beggary. "The French language,"
says A. F. Didot, "owes him much for his treatises, translations,
and poesies." Dolet's biographer, M. Joseph Boulmier, calls him "le
Christ de la pensee libre." Philosophy has alone the right, says
Henri Martin, to claim Dolet on its side. His English biographer,
R. C. Christie, says he was "neither a Catholic nor a Protestant."

Dominicis (Saverio Fausto de), Italian Positivist philosopher,
b. Buonalbergo, 1846. Is Professor of Philosophy at Bari, and has

educated at London University. In '32 he emigrated to America,
where he was Professor of Chemistry and Natural History in New
York University. He was one of the inventors of photography and the
first who applied it to astronomy. He wrote many scientific works,
notably on Human Physiology. His history of the American Civil War

Judaicus, 1811. It calls in question, with much boldness and learning,
many legends of the Old Testament, to which it gave an astronomical
signification. It was reprinted in '66. Sir William Drummond also
wrote anonymously Philosophical Sketches of the Principles of Society,
1795. Died at Rome, 29 March, 1828.

Absurdity of Christianity; a work put on the Index in '36.

Du Bois-Reymond (Emil), biologist, of Swiss father and French
mother, b. Berlin, 7 Nov. 1818. He studied at Berlin and Bonn for
the Church, but left it to follow science, '37. Has become famous as
a physiologist, especially by his Researches in Animal Electricity,
'48-60. With Helmholtz he has done much to establish the new era
of positive science, wrongly called by opponents Materialism. Du
Bois-Reymond holds that thought is a function of the brain and nervous
system, and that "soul" has arisen as the gradual results of natural
combinations, but in his Limits of the Knowledge of Nature, '72, he
contends that we must always come to an ultimate incomprehensible. Du
Bois-Reymond has written on Voltaire and Natural Science, '68; La
Mettrie, '75; Darwin versus Galiani, '78; and Frederick II. and
Rousseau, '79. Since '67 he has been perpetual secretary of the
Academy of Sciences, Berlin.

irreligion to her young comrades. The abbess called in Massillon, to
whom the little sceptic gave her reasons. He went away saying "She
is charming." Her house in Paris was for fifty years the resort of
eminent authors and statesmen. She corresponded for many years with
Horace Walpole, D'Alembert and Voltaire. Many anecdotes are told of
her; thus, to the Cardinal de Polignac, who spoke of the miracle of
St. Denis walking when beheaded, she said "Il n'y a que le premier
pas qui coute." Died 24 Sept. 1780. To the cure of Saint Sulpice,
who came to her death-bed, she said "Ni questions, ni raisons, ni

Sept. 1793, he fled to Switzerland. He was one of the Council of Five
Hundred, 1796-98. Dulaure wrote a learned Treatise on Superstitions,

a collection of anti-Christian tracts by Voltaire and others, and
wrote L'Antipapisme revele in 1767. He was in that year condemned
to perpetual imprisonment for heresy, and shut in the convent of

vivacious. He is also credited with the Portfolios of a Philosopher,
mostly taken from the Analysis of Bayle, Cologne, 1770.

17 Jan. 1877.

Dumarsais (Cesar Chesneau), French grammarian and philosopher,
b. Marseilles, 17 July, 1676. When young he entered the congregation
of the oratory. This society he soon quitted, and went to Paris,
where he married. A friend of Boindin and Alembert, he wrote against
the pretensions of Rome and contributed to the Encyclopedie. He is
credited with An Analysis of the Christian Religion and with the
celebrated Essai sur les Prejuges, par Mr. D. M., but the latter was
probably written by Holbach, with notes by Naigeon. Le Philosophe,
published in L'Evangile de la Raison by Dulaurens, was written by
Voltaire. Died 11 June, 1756. Dumarsais was very simple in character,
and was styled by D'Alembert the La Fontaine of philosophers.

prosecuted for publishing Paine's Rights of Man, but the prosecution
fell through. He afterwards published Politics for the People, which
was also prosecuted, 1793, as was his Political Dictionary, 1796. To

'12, was tried before Lord Ellenborough on a charge of blasphemy
for issuing the third and last part. He was sentenced to eighteen
months' imprisonment and to stand in the pillory. The sentence evoked
Shelley's spirited Letter to Lord Ellenborough. Eaton translated and
published Freret's Preservative against Religious Prejudices, 1812,
and shortly before his death, at Deptford, 22 Aug. 1814, he was again
prosecuted for publishing George Houston's Ecce Homo.

was brought up in the church, but persecuted for heresy in his New
Apology for Socrates, 1772, was patronised by Frederick the Great,

importance, and Moses mit Aufgedecktem Angesicht (Moses Unmasked),
1740, an attack on the Old Testament, which, he believed, proceeded
from Ezra; Die Goettlichkeit der Vernunft (The Divinity of Reason),
1741, and Christ and Belial. His works excited much controversy, and
were publicly burnt at Frankfort, 9 May, 1750. Edelmann was chased
from Brunswick and Hamburg, but was protected by Frederick the Great,
and died at Berlin, 15 Feb. 1767. Mirabeau praised him, and Guizot
calls him a "fameux esprit fort."

Edison (Thomas Alva), American inventor, b. Milan, Ohio, 10

studied electricity, invented electric light, the electric pen,
the telephone, microphone, phonograph, etc. Edison is known to be an
Agnostic and to pay no attention to religion.

Eenens (Ferdinand), Belgian writer, b. Brussels, 7 Dec. 1811. Eenens
was an officer in the Belgian army, and wrote many political and
anti-clerical pamphlets. He also wrote La Verite, a work on the

Eichhorn (Johann Gottfried), German Orientalist and rationalist, b. 16
Oct. 1752, became Professor of Oriental Literature and afterwards
Professor of Theology at Gottingen. He published Introductions to
the Old and New Testaments and A Commentary on the Apocalypse, in
which his criticism tends to uproot belief in the Bible as a divine
revelation. He lectured every day for fifty-two years. Died 25 June,
1827.

"Elborch (Conrad von)," the pseudonym of a living learned Dutch writer,
whose position does not permit him to reveal his true name. Born
14 Jan. 1865, he has contributed to De Dageraad (The Daybreak),
under various pen-names, as "Fra Diavolo," "Denis Bontemps," "J. Van
den Ende," etc. He has given, in '88, a translation of the rare and
famous Latin treatise, De Tribus Impostoribus (On Three Impostors)
[Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad], with an important bibliographic and
historical introduction.

"Eliot (George)," the pen-name of Mary Ann Lewes (nee Evans) one of
the greatest novelists of the century, b. at Arbury Farm, near Griff,
Warwickshire, 22 Nov. 1819. In '41 the family removed to Foleshill,
near Coventry. Here she made the friendship of the household of
Charles Bray, and changed her views from Evangelical Christianity
to philosophical scepticism. Influenced by The Inquiry into the
Origin of Christianity, by C. C. Hennell (Bray's brother-in-law),
she made an analysis of that work. Her first literary venture was
translating Strauss' Leben Jesu, published in 1846. After the death
of her father ('49) she travelled with the Brays upon the Continent,
and upon her return assisted Dr. Chapman in the editorship of the
Westminster Review, to which she contributed several articles. She
translated Feuerbach's Essence of Christianity, '54, the only work
published with her real name, and also translated from Spinoza's
Ethics. Introduced by Herbert Spencer to George Henry Lewes, she
linked her life with his in defiance of the conventions of society,
July, '54. Both were poor, but by his advice she turned to fiction,
in which she soon achieved success. Her Scenes of Clerical Life, Adam
Bede, Mill on the Floss, Silas Marner, Romola, Felix Holt, Middlemarch,
Daniel Deronda, and Theophrastus Such have become classics. As a poet,
"George Eliot" does not rank so high, but her little piece, "Oh,
may I join the choir invisible," well expresses the emotion of the
Religion of Humanity, and her Spanish Gipsy she allowed was "a mass
of Positivism." Lewes died in 1878, and within two years she married
his friend, J. W. Cross. Her new happiness was short-lived. She died
22 Dec. 1880, and is buried with Lewes at Highgate.

Ellero (Pietro) Italian jurisconsult, b. Pordenone, 8 Oct. 1833,

Elliotson (John, M.D., F.R.S.), an eminent medical man, b. London,
1791. He became physician at St. Thomas's Hospital in 1822, and made
many contributions to medical science. By new prescriptions of quinine,
creasote, etc., he excited much hostility in the profession. He was
the first in this country to advocate the use of the stethoscope. He
was also the first physician to discard knee-breeches and silk
stockings, and to wear a beard. In '31 he was chosen Professor at
University College, but, becoming an advocate of curative mesmerism,
he resigned his appointments, '38. He was founder and President of the
London Phrenological Society, and, in addition to many medical works,
edited the Zoist (thirteen vols.), translated Blumenbach's Physiology,
and wrote an introduction to Engledue's Cerebral Physiology, defending
materialism. Thackeray dedicated Pendennis to him, '50, and he received
a tribute of praise from Dickens. Died at London, 29 July, 1868.

Eichthal (Gustave d'), French writer, b. of Jewish family, Nancy,
22 March, 1804. He became a follower of Saint Simon, was one of the
founders of the Societe d'Ethnologie, and published Les Evangiles, a
critical analysis of the gospels, 2 vols, Paris, '63. This he followed
by The Three Great Mediterranean Nations and Christianity and Socrates
and our Time, '84. He died at Paris, April, 1886, and his son published
his Melanges de Critique Biblique (Miscellanies of Biblical Criticism),
in which there is an able study on the name and character of "Jahveh."

Emerson (Ralph Waldo), American essayist, poet, and philosopher,
b. Boston 25 May, 1803. He came of a line of ministers, and was
brought up like his father, educated at Harvard College, and ordained
as a Unitarian minister, 1829. Becoming too broad for the Church,
he resigned in '32. In the next year he came to Europe, visiting
Carlyle. On his return he settled at Concord, giving occasional
lectures, most of which have been published. He wrote to the Dial, a
transcendentalist paper. Tending to idealistic pantheism, but without
systematic philosophy, all his writings are most suggestive, and he
is always the champion of mental freedom, self-reliance, and the free
pursuit of science. Died at Concord, 27 April, 1882. Matthew Arnold
has pronounced his essays "the most important work done in prose"
in this century.

Emerson (William), English mathematician, b. Hurworth, near Darlington,
14 May, 1701. He conducted a school and wrote numerous works on
Mathematics. His vigorous, if eccentric, individuality attracted
Carlyle, who said to Mrs. Gilchrist, "Emerson was a Freethinker who
looked on his neighbor, the parson, as a humbug. He seems to have
defended himself in silence the best way he could against the noisy
clamor and unreal stuff going on around him." Died 21 May, 1782. He
compiled a list of Bible contradictions.

Emmet (Robert), Irish revolutionist, b. in Dublin 1778, was educated
as a barrister. Expelled from Dublin University for his sympathy with
the National Cause in 1798; he went to the Continent, but returned in
1802 to plan an ill-starred insurrection, for which he was executed 20
Sept. 1803. Emmet made a thrilling speech before receiving sentence,
and on the scaffold refused the services of a priest. It is well
known that his desire to see once more his sweetheart, the daughter
of Curran, was the cause of his capture and execution.

Engledue (William Collins), M.D., b. Portsea 1813. After taking his
degree at Edinburgh, he became assistant to Dr. Lizars and was elected
President of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh. He returned
to Portsmouth in 1835; originated the Royal Portsmouth Hospital and
established public baths and washhouses. He contributed to the Zoist
and published an exposition of materialism under the title of Cerebral
Physiology, 1842, republished by J. Watson, 1857. Died Jan. 1859.

Mass., 7 March, 1787. He studied law and divinity, and graduated

Christianity Examined, 1813. The work excited some controversy,
and has been reprinted at Toronto, 1839. He joined the Egyptian
service and became General of Artillery. He had a variable genius
and a gift of languages. At Marseilles he passed for a Turk with
a Turkish ambassador; and at Washington he surprised a delegation
of Cherokees by disputing with them in their own tongue. He wrote a
reply to his critics, entitled Five Smooth Stones out of the Brook,
and two letters to Channing on his sermons against infidelity. Died
at Washington, 20 Sept. 1828.

1810; A Review of the Miracles, Prophecies and Mysteries of the
Old and New Testaments, first printed as Janus on Sion, 1816, and
republished 1835; and Natural Theology Examined, 1836, the last being
republished in The Library of Reason. Bentham described him as clever
but impracticable. Died Ardress, Co. Armagh, 3 Dec. 1843.

Epicurus, Greek philosopher, b. Samos, B.C. 342. He repaired to
Athens, B.C. 323. Influenced by the works of Demokritos, he occupied
himself with philosophy. He purchased a garden in Athens, in which he
established his school. Although much calumniated, he is now admitted
to have been a man of blameless life. According to Cicero, he had no
belief in the gods, but did not attack their existence, in order not
to offend the prejudices of the Athenians. In physics he adopted the
atomic theory, and denied immortality. He taught that pleasure is the
sovereign good; but by pleasure he meant no transient sensation, but
permanent tranquility of mind. He wrote largely, but his works are
lost. His principles are expounded in the great poem of Lucretius,
De Rerum Natura. Died B.C. 270, leaving many followers.

"Erdan (Alexandre)," the pen-name of Alexandre Andre Jacob, a French
writer, b. Angles 1826. He was the natural son of a distinguished
prelate. Educated at Saint Sulpice for the Church, he read Proudhon,
and refused to take holy orders. He became a journalist and an advocate
of phonography. His work, La France Mystique (1855), in which he
gives an account of French religious eccentricities, was condemned
for its scepticism which appears on every page. Sentenced to a year's
imprisonment and a fine of three thousand francs, he took refuge in
Italy. Died at Frascati, near Rome, 24 Sept. 1878.

Ernesti (Johann August), German critic, b. Tennstadt, 4

Escherny (Francois Louis d') Count, Swiss litterateur, b. Neufchatel,
24 Nov. 1733. He spent much of his life in travel. At Paris he became
the associate of Helvetius, Diderot, and particularly Rousseau, whom he
much admired. He wrote Lacunes de la Philosophie (Amsterdam, 1783) and

Espronceda (Jose), popular Spanish poet, b. Almendralejo (Estremadura)
in 1810. After the War of Independence he went to Madrid and studied
under Alberto Lista, the poet and mathematician. He became so obnoxious
to the government by his radical principles that he was imprisoned
about the age of fifteen, and banished a few years later. He passed
several years in London and Paris, and was brought under the influence
of Byron and Hugo. He fought with the people in the Paris Revolution
of July, 1830. On the death of the Spanish King in '33 he returned
to Madrid, but was again banished for too free expression of his
opinions. He returned and took part in the revolutionary contest of
'35-36. He was elected to the Cortes in '41, and appointed secretary
of embassy to The Hague. Died 23 May, 1842. Among his works are
lyrical poems, which often remind us of Heine; an unfinished epic,
El Pelayo; and El Diablo-Mundo (the Devil-World), a fine poem, due
to the inspiration of Faust and Don Juan. Espronceda was a thorough
sceptic. In his Song of the Pirate he asks, "Who is my God?--Liberty";
and in his concluding lines to a star he says:


                I unheedingly follow my path,
                At the mercy of winds and of waves.
                Wrapt thus within the arms of Fate,
                What care I if lost or saved.


Estienne (Henri), the ablest of a family of learned French printers,
known in England as Stephens; b. Paris, 1528. At the age of
eighteen he assisted his father in collating the MSS. of Dionysius
of Halicarnassus. In 1557 he established a printing office of his
own, and issued many Greek authors; and in 1572 the Thesaurus Linguae
Graecae. His Apologie pour Herodote (Englished as a World of Wonders)
is designed as a satire on Christian legends, and directed against
priests and priestcraft. He was driven from place to place. Sir
Philip Sidney highly esteemed him, and "kindly entertained him in
his travaile." Died 1598. Garasse classes him with Atheists.

on the Trinity, he submitted them to the Archbishop of Canterbury
without obtaining satisfaction. He made some changes in reading the
Litany, and for expressing heretical opinions in a sermon in 1771,
he was prosecuted, but escaped in consequence of some irregularity
in the proceedings. In 1772 he published an anonymous tract on the
Trinity. In 1797 he addressed a letter to the Bishop of Lichfield
on the Prophecies of the New Testament, in which he tried to show
that either Christianity was false or the orthodox churches. In the
following year he resigned both his livings and took pupils. In
1792 he published his principal work, The Dissonance of the Four
Generally-Received Evangelists, in which he rejected all the gospels,
except Luke, as unauthentic. This work involved him in a controversy
with Dr. Priestley, and brought a considerable share of obloquy and
persecution from the orthodox. Died 25 Sept. 1805.

Feuerbach (Ludwig Andreas), brother of the preceding, b. Landshut,
Bavaria, 28 July 1804. He studied theology with a view to the Church,
but under the influence of Hegel abandoned it for philosophy. In '28
he was made professor at Erlangen, but was dismissed in consequence
of his first published work, Thoughts upon Death and Immortality,
'30, in which he limited immortality to personal influence on the
human race. After a wandering life he married in '37, and settled
near Anspach. He published there a history of modern philosophy from
Bacon to Spinoza. This was followed by a work on Peter Bayle. In '38

of science, asserting that the problem of philosophy is to seek
on what foundations knowledge rests. He gave moral discourses in
the lecture-room on Sunday, and was accused of holding atheistical
opinions. He was in consequence banished from Saxony, 1799. He appears
to have held that God was not a personal being, but a system of
intellectual, moral, and spiritual laws. Fichte took deep interest in
the cause of German independence, and did much to rouse his countrymen
against the domination of the French during the conquest which led to
the fall of Napoleon. Besides many publications, in which he expounds
his philosophy, he wrote eloquent treatises on The Vocation of Man,
The Nature and Vocation of the Scholar, The Way Towards the Blessed

of a distinguished surgeon, he abandoned his father's profession for
literature. His masterpiece, Madame Bovary, published in '56 in the
Revue de Paris, drew a prosecution upon that journal which ended
in a triumph for the author. For his next great work, Salammbo,
'62, an epic of Carthage, he prepared himself by long antiquarian
studies. His intellectual tendencies are displayed in The Temptation
of Saint Anthony. He stands eminent among the naturalist school for
his artistic fidelity. He was a friend of Theophile Gautier, Ivan

the son of an eminent lawyer. In 1820 he was on the staff of the
Times, and contributed to the Westminster Review. In '30 he became
editor of the Examiner, and retained his post until '47. His caustic
wit and literary attainments did much to forward advanced liberal
views. A selection of his editorials was published under the title,
England under Seven Administrations. Died 13 Oct. 1872.

Fontanier (Jean), French writer, who was burnt at the Place
de Greve, 1621, for blasphemies in a book entitled Le Tresor

by Voltaire the most universal genius of the reign of Louis XIV.,
b. Rouen, 11 Feb. 1657. Dedicated to the Virgin and St. Bernard,
he was educated at the Jesuits' College. He went to Paris in 1674;
wrote some plays and Dialogues of the Dead, 1683. In 1686 appeared

he was warmly attacked by the Jesuit Baltus, as impugning the Church
Fathers. He was made secretary to the Academy of Sciences in 1699,
a post he held forty-two years. He wrote Doubts on the Physical
System of Occasional Causes, and is also credited with a letter
on the Resurrection of the Body, a piece on The Infinite, and a
Treatise on Liberty; "but," says l'Abbe Ladvocat, "as these books
contain many things contrary to religion, it is to be hoped they are
not his." Fontenelle nearly reached the age of one hundred. A short
time before he died (9 Jan. 1757), being asked if he felt any pain,
"I only feel," he replied, "a difficulty of existing."

Foote (George William), writer and orator, b. Plymouth, 11
Jan. 1850. Was "converted" in youth, but became a Freethinker by
reading and independent thought. Came to London in 1868, and was soon a
leading member of the Young Men's Secular Association. He taught in the
Hall of Science Sunday School, and became secretary of the Republican
League. Devoting his time to propagating his principles, he wrote
in the Secular Chronicle and National Reformer, and in '76 started
the Secularist in conjunction with Mr. G. J. Holyoake, and after
the ninth number conducting it alone. This afterwards merged in the
Secular Review. In '79 Mr. Foote edited the Liberal, and in Sept. '81,
started the Freethinker, which he still edits. In the following year
a prosecution was commenced by the Public Prosecutor, who attempted
to connect Mr. Bradlaugh with it. Undaunted, Mr. Foote issued a
Christmas number with an illustrated "Comic Life of Christ." For
this a prosecution was started by the City authorities against him
and his publisher and printer, and the trial came on first in March,
'83. The jury disagreed, but Judge North refused to discharge the
prisoners, and they were tried again on the 5th March; Judge North
directing that a verdict of guilty must be returned, and sentencing
Mr. Foote to one year's imprisonment as an ordinary criminal subject
to the same "discipline" as burglars. "I thank you, my lord; your
sentence is worthy of your creed," he remarked. On 24 April, '83,
Mr. Foote was brought from prison before Lord Coleridge and a special
jury on the first charge, and after a splendid defence, upon which
he was highly complimented by the judge, the jury disagreed. He has

violently attacked by the Catholics. This work has gone through
several editions. M. Fonillee has also written an able History of
Philosophy, 1875, Contemporary Social Science, and an important
Critique of Contemporary Moral Systems (1883). He has written much
in the Revue des Deux Mondes, and is considered, with Taine, Ribot,
and Renan, the principal representative of French philosophy. His
system is known as that of idees-forces, as he holds that ideas are
themselves forces. His latest work expounds the views of M. Guyau.

Forberg (Friedrich Karl), German philosopher, b. Meuselwitz, 30
Aug. 1770, studied theology at Leipsic, and became private docent
at Jena. Becoming attached to Fichte's philosophy, he wrote with
Fichte in Niethammer's Philosophical Journal on "The Development
of Religious Ideas," and an article on "The Ground of our Faith in
Divine Providence," which brought on them a charge of Atheism, and
the journal was confiscated by the Electorate of Saxony. Forberg held
religion to consist in devotion to morality, and wrote An Apology
for Alleged Atheism, 1799. In 1807 he became librarian at Coburg,

Classique. Died Hildburghausen 1 Jan. 1848.

to the Government of Oudh. He retired in '77 after an active service of
33 years, during which he frequently received the thanks of the Indian
and Home Governments. In his youth he was an active Evangelical,
preaching to the natives in their own tongues. He has, however,
given his testimony that during his long experience he has known no
one converted solely by force of reasoning or "Christian evidences." A
great student of Eastern religions, archaeology, and languages, he has
written in various periodicals of the East and West, and has embodied
the result of many years researches in two illustrated quarto volumes
called Rivers of Life, setting forth the evolution of all religions
from their radical objective basis to their present spiritualised
developments. In an elaborate chart he shows by streams of color the
movements of thought from 10,000 B.C. to the present time.

some heretical words in his letter, in which he associates the names
of Christ, Moses, and Mohammed, he was reported author of the famous

"Ignorance is the mother of devotion." Died at Florence, 13 Dec. 1250.

Frederick the Great (King of Prussia), b. 24 Jan. 1712, was educated in
a very rigid fashion by his father, Frederick William I. He ascended
the throne and soon displayed his political and military ability. By
a war with Austria he acquired Silesia. He wrote several deistical
pieces, and tolerated all religions and no religion saying "every man
must get to heaven his own way." He attracted to his court men like
Lamettrie, D'Argens, Maupertuis, and Voltaire, who, says Carlyle,
continued all his days Friedrich's chief thinker. In 1756 France,
Austria, Sweden, and Russia united against him, but he held his own

pupil of Rollin, and was patronised by Boulainvilliers. Distinguished
by his attainments in ancient history, philosophy and chronology,
he became member of the Academy of Inscriptions 1714. For a Discourse
on the "Origin of the Franks," he was incarcerated for four months in
the Bastille. While here he read Bayle so often that he could repeat

Letters from Thrasybulus to Leucippe on Natural and Revealed Religion,
and perhaps of La Moisade, a criticism of the Pentateuch, translated
by D. I. Eaton, as A Preservative against Religious Prejudices. The

a rationalist and abandoned his fellowship and clerical life. His
Nemesis of Faith, '48, showed the nature of his objections. Mr. Froude
devoted his abilities to a literary career, and fell under the
influence of Carlyle. For many years he edited Fraser's Magazine,
in which he wrote largely. His essays are collected under the title
of Short Studies on Great Subjects, '71-83. His largest work is the
History of England, from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the
Spanish Armada, '56-76. His Life of Carlyle, '82, and publication
of Carlyle's Reminiscenses provoked much controversy. His magical
translation of Lucian's most characteristic Dialogue of the Gods
is done with too much verve to allow of the supposition that the
translator is not in sympathy with his author.

Fry (John), a colonel in the Parliamentary army. In 1640 he was
elected one of the burgesses of Shaftesbury, but his return was
declared void. After serving with distinction in the army, he was

taking the clerical habit, he refused and went to America. After
travelling much, he established a day school in Barcelona and founded
an Anti-clerical League of Freethinkers pledged to live without
priests. This induced much clerical wrath, especially when Dr. Gabarro
founded some 200 Anti-clerical groups and over 100 lay schools. For
denouncing the assassins of a Freethinker he was pursued for libel,
sentenced to four years' imprisonment, and forced to fly to Cerbere
on the frontier, where he continues his anti-clerical journal La

one. Educated at a clerical seminary, he decided to study for the
law. In '59 he was enrolled at the bar. His defence of Delescluze
(14 Nov. 1868), in which he vigorously attacked the Empire, made
him famous. Elected to the Assembly by both Paris and Marseilles, he
became the life and leader of the Opposition. After Sedan he proclaimed
the Republic and organised the national defences, leaving Paris, then
invested by the Germans, in a balloon. From Tours he invigorated every
department, and was the inspiration of the few successes won by the
French. Gambetta preserved the Republic against all machinations,
and compelled MacMahon to accept the second of the alternatives,
"Se soumettre ou se demettre." He founded the Republique Francaise,

Rome made him long to free his country. He joined Mazzini's movement,
"Young Italy," and being implicated in the Genoese revolt of '33,
he fled at risk of his life to Marseilles, where he learnt he was
sentenced to death. He went to South America and fought on behalf of
the republic of Uruguay. Here he met Anita Rivera, his beautiful and
brave wife, who accompanied him in numerous adventures. Returning to
Italy he fought against the Austrians in '48, and next year was the
soul of resistance to the French troops, who came to restore Papal
authority. Garibaldi had to retire; his wife died, and he escaped
with difficulty to Genoa, whence he went to New York, working for
an Italian soap and candlemaker at Staten Island. In '54 he returned
and bought a farm on the isle of Caprera. In '59 he again fought the
Austrians, and in May, '60, landed at Marsala, Sicily, took Palermo,
and drove Francis II. from Naples. Though a Republican he saluted
Victor Emanuel as King of Italy. Vexed by the cessation of Nice to
France, he marched to Rome, but was wounded by Victor Emanuel's
troops, and taken prisoner to Varignaro. Here he wrote his Rule
of the Monk, a work exhibiting his love of liberty and hatred of
the priesthood. In '64 he visited England, and was enthusiastically

the Papal government. In '71 he placed his sword at the service of
the French Republic, and the only standard taken from the Germans was

Gautama (called also Gotama, Buddha, and Sakyamuni), great Hindu
reformer and founder of Buddhism, b. Kapilavastu, 624 B.C. Many
legends are told of his birth and life. He is said to have been a
prince, who, pained with human misery, left his home to dedicate
himself to emancipation. His system was rather a moral discipline
than a religion. Though he did not deny the Hindu gods he asserted
that all beings were subject to "Karma," the result of previous
actions. He said, "If a man for a hundred years worship Agni in the
forest, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul
is grounded in true knowledge, better is that homage than sacrifice
for a hundred years." According to Ceylonese writers Gautama Buddha
died at Kusinagara, B.C. 543.

could write French, one was Theophile Gautier. Died 22 Oct. 1872.

of distinguished men. Here he brought out the works of Schiller and
his own dramas, of which Faust is the greatest. His chief prose work
is Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship. His works are voluminous. He
declared himself "decidedly non-Christian," and said his objects of
hate were "the cross and bugs." He was averse to abstractions and
refused to recognise a Deity distinct from the world. In philosophy
he followed Spinoza, and he disliked and discountenanced the popular
creed. Writing to Lavater in 1772 he said: "You look upon the gospel as
it stands as the divinest truth: but even a voice from heaven would not
convince me that water burns and fire quenches, that a woman conceives
without a man, and that a dead man can rise again. To you, nothing is
more beautiful than the Gospel; to me, a thousand written pages of
ancient and modern inspired men are equally beautiful." Goethe was
opposed to asceticism, and Pfleiderer admits "stood in opposition
to Christianity not merely on points of theological form, but to
a certain extent on points of substance too." Goethe devoted much
attention to science, and he attempted to explain the metamorphosis
of plants on evolutionary principles in 1790. Died 22 March, 1832.

with Schelling, devoted his attention to philosophy. His Encyclopaedia
of the Philosophical Sciences made a deep impression in Germany, and
two schools sprang up, one claiming it as a philosophical statement
of Christianity, the other as Pantheism hostile to revelation. Hegel
said students of philosophy must begin with Spinozism. He is said to

he twice suffered sentences of six months' imprisonment. He afterwards
published The Unstamped, and his persistency had much to do in removing
the taxes. While in prison he wrote his Cheap Salvation in consequence
of conversation with the chaplain of Clerkenwell Gaol. On Dec. 8, '40,

years of his life were spent at the seat of the Duke of Devonshire,
Chatsworth, where he died 4 Dec. 1679.

Hodgson (William, M.D.), English Jacobin, translator of d'Holbach's
System of Nature (1795). In 1794 he was confined in Newgate for two
years for drinking to the success of the French Republic. In prison
he wrote The Commonwealth of Reason.

Hoelderlin (Johann Christian Friedrich), German pantheistic poet,
b. Laufen, 20 March, 1770. Entered as a theological student at
Tuebingen, but never took to the business. He wrote Hyperion, a
fine romance (1797-99), and Lyric Poems, admired for their depth of
thought. Died Tuebingen, 7 June, 1843.

Hoijer (Benjamin Carl Henrik), Swedish philosopher, b. Great Skedvi,
Delecarlia, 1 June, 1767. Was student at Upsala University '83,
and teacher of philosophy '98. His promotion was hindered by his
liberal opinions. By his personal influence and published treatises he
contributed much to Swedish emancipation. In 1808 he became Professor
of Philosophy at Upsala. Died 8 June, 1812.

Holbach (Paul Heinrich Dietrich von) Baron, b. Heidelsheim
Jan. 1723. Brought up at Paris where he spent most of his life. Rich
and generous he was the patron of the Encyclopaedists. Buffon, Diderot,
d'Alembert, Helvetius, Rousseau, Grimm, Raynal, Marmontel, Condillac,
and other authors often met at his table. Hume, Garrick, Franklin,
and Priestley were also among his visitors. He translated from the
German several works on chemistry and mineralogy, and from the English,
Mark Akenside's Pleasures of the Imagination. He contributed many
articles to the Encyclopedie. In 1765 he visited England, and from
this time was untiring in his issue of Freethought works, usually put
out under pseudonyms. Thus he wrote and had published at Amsterdam
Christianity Unveiled, attributed to Boulanger. The Spirit of the
Clergy, translated, from the English of Trenchard and Gordon, was
partly rewritten by d'Holbach, 1767. His Sacred Contagion or Natural
History of Superstition, was also wrongly attributed to Trenchard
and Gordon. This work was condemned to be burnt by a decree of the
French parliament, 8 Aug. 1770. D'Holbach also wrote and published
The History of David, 1768, The Critical History of Jesus Christ,
Letters to Eugenia, attributed to Freret, Portable Theology, attributed
to Bernier, an Essay on Prejudices, attributed to M. Du M [arsais],
Religious Cruelty, Hell Destroyed, and other works, said to be from
the English. He also translated the Philosophical Letters of Toland,
and Collins's Discourses on Prophecy, and attributed to the latter a
work with the title The Spirit of Judaism. These works were mostly
conveyed to the printer, M. Rey, at Amsterdam, by Naigeon, and the
secret of their authorship was carefully preserved. Hence d'Holbach
escaped persecution. In 1770 he published his principal work The
System of Nature, or The Laws of the Physical and Moral World. This
text-book of atheistic philosophy, in which d'Holbach was assisted
by Diderot, professed to be the posthumous work of Mirabaud. It made
a great sensation. Within two years he published a sort of summary
under the title of Good Sense, attributed to the cure Meslier. In
1773 he wrote on Natural Politics and the Social System. His last
important work was Universal Morality; or the Duties of Man founded
upon Nature. D'Holbach, whose personal good qualities were testified to
by many, was depicted in Rousseau's Nouvelle Heloise as the benevolent
Atheist Wolmar. Died 21 Jan. 1789.

Holcroft (Thomas), English author, b. 10 Dec. 1745, was successively
a groom, shoemaker, schoolmaster, actor and author. His comedies
"Duplicity," 1781, and "The Road to Ruin," 1792, were very
successful. He translated the Posthumous Works of Frederick the
Great, 1789. For his active sympathy with the French Republicans he
was indicted for high treason with Hardy and Horne Tooke in 1794,
but was discharged without a trial. Died 23 March, 1809.

Holland (Frederic May), American author, b. Boston, 2 May, 1836,
graduated at Harvard in '49, and in '63 was ordained Unitarian minister
at Rockford, Ill. Becoming broader in his views, he resigned, and has
since written in the Truthseeker, the Freethinkers' Magazine, etc. His
principal work is entitled The Rise of Intellectual Liberty, 1885.

Hollick (Dr. Frederick), Socialist, b. Birmingham, 22 Dec. 1813. He was
educated at the Mechanics' Institute of that town, and became one of
the Socialist lecturers under Robert Owen. He held a public discussion
with J. Brindley at Liverpool, in 1840, on "What is Christianity?" On
the failure of Owenism he went to America, where some of his works
popularising medical science have had a large circulation.

Hollis (John), English sceptic, b. 1757. Author of Sober and Serious
Reasons for Scepticism, 1796; An Apology for Disbelief in Revealed
Religion, 1799; and Free Thoughts, 1812. Died at High Wycombe, Bucks
26 Nov. 1824. Hollis, who came of an opulent dissenting family, was
distinguished by his love of truth, his zeal in the cause of freedom,
and by his beneficence.

Holmes (William Vamplew), one of Carlile's brave shopmen who came up
from Leeds to uphold the right of free publication. He was sentenced
to two years' imprisonment, 1 March, '22, for selling blasphemous
and seditious libels in An Address to the Reformers of Great Britain,
and when in prison was told that "if hard labor was not expressed in
his sentence, it was implied." On his release Holmes went to Sheffield
and commenced the open sale of all the prohibited publications.

Holwell (John Zephaniah), noted as one of the survivors of the Black
Hole of Calcutta, b. Dublin, 7 Sept. 1711. He practised as a surgeon,
went to India as a clerk, defended a fort at Calcutta against Surajah
Dowlah, was imprisoned with one hundred and forty-five others in the
"Black Hole," 20th June, 1756, of which he published a Narrative. He
succeeded Clive as governor of Bengal. On returning to England
he published a dissertation directed against belief in a special
providence, and advocating the application of church endowments to
the exigencies of the State (Bath, 1786). Died 5 Nov. 1798.

Holyoake (Austin), English Freethinker, b. Birmingham, 27
Oct. 1826. His mental emancipation came from hearing the lectures of
Robert Owen and his disciples. He took part in the agitation for the
abolition of the newspaper stamp--assisting when risk and danger had
to be met--and he co-operated with his brother in the production of
the Reasoner and other publications from '45 till '62. Soon after
this he printed and sub-edited the National Reformer, in which
many of his Freethought articles appeared. Among his pamphlets may
be mentioned Heaven and Hell, Ludicrous Aspects of Christianity,
Thoughts on Atheism, the Book of Esther, and Daniel the Dreamer. He
also composed a Secular Burial Service. Austin Holyoake took pride
in the character of Freethought, and was ever zealous in promoting
its welfare. His amiable spirit endeared him to all who knew him. He
died 10 April, 1874, leaving behind thoughts written on his deathbed,
in which he repudiated all belief in theology.

Holyoake (George Jacob), b. Birmingham, 13 April 1817. Became
mathematical teacher of the Mechanics' Institution. Influenced by Combe
and Owen he became a Freethinker, and in '40 a Socialist missionary. In
'42, when Southwell was imprisoned for writing in the Oracle of Reason,
Mr. Holyoake took charge of that journal, and wrote The Spirit of
Bonner in the Disciples of Jesus. He was soon arrested for a speech
at Cheltenham, having said, in answer to a question, that he would put
the Deity on half-pay. Tried Aug. '42, he was sentenced to six months
imprisonment, of which he gave a full account in his Last Trial by
Jury for Atheism in England. In Dec. '43 he edited with M. Q. Ryall
the Movement, bearing the motto from Bentham, "Maximise morals,
minimise religion." The same policy was pursued in The Reasoner,
which he edited from 1846 till 1861. Among his many pamphlets we must
notice the Logic of Death, '50, which went through numerous editions,
and was included in his most important Freethought work, The Trial
of Theism. In '49 he published a brief memoir of R. Carlile. In
'51 he first used the term "Secularist," and in Oct. '52 the first
Secular Conference was held at Manchester Mr. Holyoake presiding. In
Jan. '53 he held a six nights discussion with the Rev. Brewin Grant,
and again in Oct. '54. He purchased the business of James Watson,
and issued many Freethought works, notably The Library of Reason--a
series, The Cabinet of Reason, his own Secularism, The Philosophy of
the People, etc. In '60 he was Secretary to the British Legion sent out
to Garibaldi. Mr. Holyoake did much to remove the taxes upon knowledge,
and has devoted much attention to Co-operation, having written a
history of the movement and contributed to most of its journals.

Home (Henry), Scottish judge, was b. 1696. His legal ability was
made known by his publication of Remarkable Decisions of the Court of
Session, 1728. In 1752 he was raised to the bench as Lord Kames. He

(1751), Elements of Criticism (1762), and Sketches of the History
of Man, in which he proved himself in advance of his age. Died 27
Dec. 1782.

science to proclaim his adoption of Darwinism.

Hope (Thomas), novelist and antiquarian, b. 1770. Famous for his
anonymous Anastasius, or Memories of a Modern Greek, he also wrote an
original work on The Origin and Prospects of Man '31. Died at London

(The Law of Causality).

Houston (George). Was the translator of d'Holbach's Ecce Homo, first
published in Edinburgh in 1799, and sometimes ascribed to Joseph
Webb. A second edition was issued in 1813. Houston was prosecuted and
was imprisoned two years in Newgate, with a fine of L200. He afterwards
went to New York, where he edited the Minerva (1822). In Jan. 1827,
he started The Correspondence, which, we believe, was the first weekly
Freethought journal published in America. It lasted till July 1828. He
also republished Ecce Homo. Houston helped to establish in America a
"Free Press Association" and a Society of Free Inquirers.

'45. He gave his cordial adhesion to the Republic of '48, and was
elected to the Assembly by the voters of Paris. He attacked Louis
Napoleon, and after the coup d'etat was proscribed. He first went to
Brussels, where he published Napoleon the Little, a biting satire. He
afterwards settled at Guernsey, where he remained until the fall of
the Empire, producing The Legend of the Ages, '59, Les Miserables, '62,
Toilers of the Sea, '69, and other works. After his return to Paris he
produced a new series of the Legend of the Ages, The Pope, Religions
and Religion, Torquemada, and other poems. He died 22 May, 1885,

was secularised for that purpose, the cross being removed. Since his
death a poem entitled The End of Satan has been published.

Heyne and Blumenbach, travelled in Holland, France and England
with George Forster, the naturalist, and became director-general
of mines. In 1799 he set out to explore South America and Mexico,
and in 1804 returned with a rich collection of animals, plants and
minerals. Humboldt became a resident of Paris, where he enjoyed
the friendship of Lalande, Delambre, Arago, and all the living
distinguished French scientists. After numerous important contributions
to scientific knowledge, at the age of seventy-four he composed his
celebrated Cosmos, the first volume of which appeared in '45 and the
fourth in '58. To Varnhagen von Ense he wrote in 1841: "Bruno Bauer
has found me pre-adamatically converted. Many years ago I wrote,
'Toutes les religions positives offrent trois parties distinctes;
un traite de moeurs partout le meme et tres pur, un reve geologique,
et un mythe ou petit roman historique; le dernier element obtient
le plus d'importance.'" Later on he says that Strauss disposes of
"the Christian myths." Humboldt was an unwearied student of science,
paying no attention to religion, and opposed his brother in regard to
his essay On the Province of the Historian, because he considered it
to acknowledge the belief in the divine government of the world, which
seemed to him as complete a delusion as the hypothesis of a principle
of life. He died in Berlin, 6 May, 1859, in his ninetieth year.

Humboldt (Karl Wilhelm von), Prussian statesman and philosopher,
b. Potsdam, 22 June, 1767. He was educated by Campe. Went to Paris in
1789, and hailed the revolution with enthusiasm. In '92 he published
Ideas on the Organization of the State. He became a friend of Schiller
and Goethe, and in 1809 was Minister of Public Instruction. He took
part in founding the University of Berlin. He represented Prussia at
the Congress of Vienna, '14. He advocated a liberal constitution, but
finding the King averse, retired at the end of '19, and devoted himself
to the study of comparative philology. He said there were three things
he could not comprehend--orthodox piety, romantic love, and music. He
died 8 April, 1835. His works were collected and edited by his brother.

Hume (David), philosopher and historian, b. Edinburgh, 26 April,
1711. In 1735 he went to France to study, and there wrote his Treatise
on Human Nature, published in 1739. This work then excited no interest
friendly or hostile. Hume's Essays Moral and Political appeared in
1742, and in 1752 his Inquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals which
of all his writings he considered the best. In 1755 he published his
Natural History of Religion, which was furiously attacked by Warburton
in an anonymous tract. In 1754 he published the first volume of his
History of England, which he did not complete till 1761. He became
secretary to the Earl of Hertford, ambassador at Paris, where he was
cordially welcomed by the philosophers. He returned in 1766, bringing
Rousseau with him. Hume became Under Secretary of State in 1767,
and in 1769 retired to Edinburgh, where he died 25 Aug. 1776. After
his death his Dialogues on Natural Religion were published, and also
some unpublished essays on Suicide, the Immortality of the Soul,
etc. Hume's last days were singularly cheerful. His friend, the famous
Dr. Adam Smith, considered him "as approaching as nearly to the idea
of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human
frailty will permit."

Hunt (James), Ph.D., physiologist, b. 1833, was the founder of the
Anthropological Society, of which he was the first president, '63. He
was the author of the Negro's Place in Nature, a work on Stammering,

Middlesex, 19 Oct. 1784. was educated with Lamb and Coleridge at

first the Sunday News, 1805, and then the Examiner, 1808. They were
condemned to pay a fine, each of L500, and to be imprisoned for
two years, 1812-14, for a satirical article, in which the prince
regent was called an "Adonis of fifty." This imprisonment procured
him the friendship of Shelley and Byron, with whom, after editing
the Indicator he was associated in editing the Liberal. He wrote many
choice books of poems and criticisms, and in his Religion of the Heart,
'53, repudiates orthodoxy. Died 28 Aug. 1859.

Hutten (Ulrich von), German poet and reformer, b. of noble family
Steckelberg, Hesse Cassel, 22 April 1488. He was sent to Fulda
to become a monk, but fled in 1504 to Erfurt, where he studied
humaniora. After some wild adventures he went to Wittenberg in 1510,
and Vienna 1512, and also studied at Pavia and Bologna. He returned to
Germany in 1517 as a common soldier in the army of Maximilian. His
great object was to free his country from sacerdotalism, and
most of his writings are satires against the Pope, monks and
clergy. Persecution drove him to Switzerland, but the Council of
Zurich drove him out of their territory and he died on the isle of
Ufnau, Lake Zuerich, 29 Aug. 1523.

Hutton (James), Scotch geologist and philosopher, b. at Edinburgh 3
June, 1736. He graduated as M.D. at Leyden in 1749, and investigated
the strata of the north of Scotland. He published a dissertation
on Light, Heat, and Fire, and in his Theory of the World, 1795,
attributes geological phenomena to the action of fire. He also wrote
a work entitled An Investigation of the Principles of Knowledge,
the opinions of which, says Chalmers, "abound in sceptical boldness
and philosophical infidelity." Died 26 March 1797.

Huxley (Thomas Henry), LL.D., Ph.D., F.R.S., b. Ealing, 4 May, 1825. He
studied medicine, and in '46 took M.R.C.S., and was appointed assistant
naval surgeon. His cruises afforded opportunities for his studies of
natural history. In '51 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and
in '54 was made Professor at the School of Mines. In '60 he lectured on
"The Relation of Man to the Lower Animals," and afterwards published
Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature (1863). In addition to numerous
scientific works, Professor Huxley has written numerous forcible
articles, addresses, etc., collected in Lay Sermons, '70; Critiques
and Addresses, '73; and American Addresses, '79. A vigorous writer,
his Hume in the "English Men of Letters" series is a model of clear
exposition. In his controversies with Mr. Gladstone, in his articles
on the Evolution of Theology, and in his recent polemic with the
Rev. Mr. Wace in the Nineteenth Century, Professor Huxley shows all
his freshness, and proves himself as ready in demolishing theological
fictions as in demonstrating scientific facts. He states as his own
life aims "The popularising of science and untiring opposition to
that ecclesiastical spirit, that clericalism, which in England,
as everywhere else, and to whatever denomination it may belong,
is the deadly enemy of science."

Hypatia, Pagan philosopher and martyr, b. Alexandria early in
the second half of the fourth century. She became a distinguished
lecturer and head of the Neo-Platonic school (c. 400). The charms of
her eloquence brought many disciples. By a Christian mob, incited by
St. Cyril, she was in Lent 415 torn from her chariot, stripped naked,
cut with oyster-shells and finally burnt piecemeal. This true story
of Christian persecution has been disguised into a legend related of
St. Catherine in the Roman breviary (Nov. 25).

he became director of the theatre at Bergen, for which he wrote a
great deal. From '57 to '63 he directed the theatre at Christiania. In
the following year he went to Rome. The Storthing accorded him an
annual pension for his services to literature. His dramas, Brand,
(Peer Gynt), Kejser og Galilaer (Caesar [Julian] and the Galilean),
Nora, and Samfundets Stotler (the Pillars of Society), and Ghosts
exhibit his unconventional spirit. Ibsen is an open unbeliever in
Christianity. He looks forward to social regeneration through liberty,
individuality, and education without superstition.

'77 he refused the post of Minister to Germany. He has conducted
many important cases, and defended C. B. Reynolds when tried for
blasphemy in '86. Col. Ingersoll is the most popular speaker in
America. Eloquence, humor, and pathos are alike at his command. He is
well known by his books, pamphlets, and speeches directed against
Christianity. He had published the Gods, Ghosts, Some Mistakes
of Moses, and a collection of his Lectures, '83, and Prose Poems
and Extracts, '84. Most of his lectures have been republished in
England. We mention What must I do to be Saved? Hell, The Dying Creed,

which he was rector till his death, 4 July 1826. Dr. J. Thomas in his
Dictionary of Biography says "In religion he was what is denominated a
freethinker." He spoke in old age of "the hocus-pocus phantom of God,
which like another Cerberus had one body and three heads." See his
life by J. Parton.

Joseph II., Emperor of Germany, son of Francis I. and Maria Theresa,
b. Vienna 13 March 1741. In 1764 he was elected king of the Romans, and
in the following year succeeded to the throne of Germany. He wrought
many reforms, suppressed the Jesuits 1773, travelled in France as Count
Falkenstein, saw d'Alembert but did not visit Voltaire. He abolished
serfdom, allowed liberty of conscience, suppressed several convents,
regulated others, abridged the power of the pope and the clergy,
and mitigated the condition of the Jews. Carlyle says "a mighty
reformer he had been, the greatest of his day. Austria gazed on him,
its admiration not unmixed with terror. He rushed incessantly about,
hardy as a Charles Twelfth; slept on his bearskin on the floor of any
inn or hut;--flew at the throat of every absurdity, however broad
and based or dangerously armed. 'Disappear I say.' A most prompt,
severe, and yet beneficent and charitable kind of man. Immensely
ambitious, that must be said withal. A great admirer of Friedrich;
bent to imitate him with profit. 'Very clever indeed' says Friedrich,
'but has the fault (a terribly grave one!) of generally taking the
second step without having taken the first.'" Died Vienna 20 Feb. 1790.

Jouy (Victor Joseph Etienne de), French author b. Jouy near Versailles
1764. He served as soldier in India and afterwards in the wars of

he escaped. He was educated in the tenets of Christianity but
returned to an eclectic Paganism. In 354 he was declared Caesar. He
made successful campaigns against the Germans who had overrun Gaul
and in 361 was made Emperor. He proclaimed liberty of conscience
and sought to uproot the Christian superstition by his writings, of
which only fragments remain. As Emperor he exhibited great talent,
tact, industry, and skill. He was one of the most gifted and learned
of the Roman Emperors, and his short reign (Dec. 361--26 June, 363),
comprehended the plans of a life-long administration. He died while
seeking to repel a Persian invasion, and his death was followed by
the triumph of Christianity and the long night of the dark ages.

Junghuhn (Franz Wilhelm), traveller and naturalist, b. Mansfeld,
Prussia 29 Oct 1812. His father was a barber and surgeon. Franz
studied at Halle and Berlin. He distinguished himself by love for
botany and geology. In a duel with another student he killed him and

he simulated madness and was removed to the asylum at Coblentz,
whence he escaped to Algiers. In '34 he joined the Dutch Army in the
Malay Archipelago. He travelled through the island of Java making
a botanical and geological survey. In '54 he published his Licht
en Schaduwbeelden uit de binnenlanden van Java (Light and Shadow
pictures from the interior of Java), which contains his ideas of God,
religion and science, together with sketches of nature and of the
manners of the inhabitants. This book aroused much indignation from
the pious, but also much agreement among freethinkers, and led to
the establishment of De Dageraad (The Daybreak,) the organ of the
Dutch Freethinkers Union. Junghuhn afterwards returned to Java and
died 21 April, '64 at Lemberg, Preanges, Regentsch. His Light and
Shadow pictures have been several times reprinted.

16 May, 1828. Educated at the University of Berlin, where he
studied under Vatke and others. Early in '49 he came to England as a
political refugee, and found employment as tutor to the Rothschild
family. His critical Commentary on the Pentateuch commenced with a
volume on Exodus, '55, Genesis '58, Leviticus in two vols. in '67
and '72 respectively. His rational criticism anticipated the school
of Wellhausen. He published Bible Studies on Balaam and Jonah '77,
and discussions on philosophy and religion in a very able and learned
work entitled Path and Goal, '80. Kalisch also contributed to Scott's
series of Freethought tracts. Died at Baslow, Derbyshire, 23 Aug. 1885.

Kames (Lord). See Home (Henry).

Kant (Immanuel), German critical philosopher, b. Koenigsberg, 22
April, 1724. He became professor of mathematics in 1770. In 1781 he
published his great work, The Critick of Pure Reason, which denied
all knowledge of the "Thing itself," and overthrew the dogmatism of
earlier metaphysics. In 1792 the philosopher fell under the royal
censorship for his Religion within the Limits of Pure Reason. Kant
effected a complete revolution in philosophy, and his immediate
influence is not yet exhausted. Died at Koenigsberg, 12 Feb. 1804.

Kapila. One of the earliest Hindu thinkers. His system is known as
the Atheistic philosophy. It is expounded in the Sankhya Karika, an

his days. Died at Giessen, where he was professor, 17 Nov. 1878.

Keith (George), Lord Marshall, Scotch soldier, b. Kincardine 1685,

wounded at Sheriffmuir, 1715. He afterwards served with distinction
in Spain and in Russia, where he rose to high favor under the
Empress Elizabeth. In 1747 he took service with Frederick the Great
as field-marshal, and became Governor of Berlin. Carlyle calls him
"a very clear-eyed, sound observer of men and things. Frederick, the
more he knows him, likes him the better." From their correspondence
it is evident Keith shared the sceptical opinions of Frederick. After
brilliant exploits in the seven years' war at Prague, Rossbach, and
Olmutz, Marshal Keith fell in the battle of Hochkirch, 14 Oct. 1758.

Kenrick (William), LL.D., English author, b. near Watford, Herts,

Soame Jenyns's work on Christianity. He translated some of the works
of Buffon, Rousseau, and Voltaire. Died 10 June 1779.

our Saviour."

Khayyam (Omar) or Umar Khaiyam, Persian astronomer, poet, b. Naishapur
Khorassan, in the second half of the eleventh century, and was
distinguished by his reformation of the calendar as well as by his
verses (Rubiyat), which E. Fitzgerald has so finely rendered in
English. He alarmed his contemporaries and made himself obnoxious to
the Sufis. Died about 1123. Omar laughed at the prophets and priests,
and told men to be happy instead of worrying themselves about God and
the Hereafter. He makes his soul say, "I myself am Heaven and Hell."

became a Baptist and afterwards a Universalist minister. He invented
a new system of orthography, published a translation of the New
Testament, 1823, The Deist (2 Vols.), '22, edited the Olive Branch
and the Christian Inquirer. He wrote The Fourth Epistle of Peter,
'29, and a Review of the Evidences of Christianity, being a series
of lectures delivered in New York in '29. In that year he removed to
Boston, and in April '31 commenced the Boston Investigator, the oldest
Freethought journal. In '33 he was indicted and tried for blasphemy
for saying that he "did not believe in the God which Universalists
did." He was sentenced 21 Jan. '34, to two months' imprisonment and
fine of five hundred dollars. The verdict was confirmed in the Courts
of Appeal in '36, and he received two months' imprisonment. Kneeland
was a Pantheist. He took Frances Wright as an associate editor, and
soon after left the Boston Investigator in the hands of P. Mendum and
Seaver, and retired to a farm at Salubria, where he died 27 August,
1844. His edition, with notes, of Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary,
was published in two volumes in 1852.

Knutzen (Matthias), b. Oldensworth, in Holstein, 1645. He early lost
his parents, and was brought to an uncle at Koenigsberg, where he
studied philosophy. He took to the adventurous life of a wandering
scholar and propagated his principles in many places. In 1674 he
preached Atheism publicly at Jena, in Germany, and had followers who
were called "Gewissener," from their acknowledging no other authority
but conscience. It is said there were seven hundred in Jena alone. What
became of him and them is unknown. A letter dated from Rome gives his
principles. He denied the existence of either God or Devil, deemed
churches and priests useless, and held that there is no life beyond
the present, for which conscience is a sufficient guide, taking the
place of the Bible, which contains great contradictions. He also
wrote two dialogues.

Koerbagh (Adriaan), Dutch martyr, b. Amsterdam, 1632 or 1633. He became
a doctor of law and medicine. In 1668 he published A Flower Garden
of all Loveliness, a dictionary of definitions in which he gave bold
explanations. The work was rigidly suppressed, and the writer fled
to Culemborg. There he translated a book De Trinitate, and began a
work entitled A Light Shining in Dark Places, to illuminate the chief
things of theology and religion by Vrederijk Waarmond, inquisitor of

Lalande (Joseph Jerome le Francais de), distinguished French
astronomer, b. Bourg en Bresse, 11 July 1732. Educated by the Jesuits,
he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences in his 20th year. In
1762 he became Professor of Astronomy at the College of France. In
1764 he published his Treatise of Astronomy, to which Dupuis subjoined
a memoir, which formed the basis of his Origin of all Religions, the
idea of which he had taken from Lalande. In Aug 1793 Lalande hazarded
his own life to save Dupont de Nemours, and some priests whom he
concealed in the observatory of Mazarin college. It was upon Lalande's
observations that the Republican calender was drawn up. At Lalande's
instigation Sylvain Marechal published his Dictionary of Atheists,
to which the astronomer contributed supplements after Marechal's
death. Lalande professed himself prouder of being an Atheist than
of being an astronomer. His Bibliographie Astronomique is called by
Prof. de Morgan "a perfect model of scientific bibliography." It was
said that never did a young man address himself to Lalande without
receiving proof of his generosity. He died at Paris 4 April, 1807.

Lamarck (Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet) French naturalist,
b. Picardy 1 Aug. 1744, educated for the Church, but entered the army
in 1761, and fought with distinction. Having been disabled, he went
to Paris, studied Botany, and published French Flora in 1788, which
opened to him the Academy of Sciences. He became assistant at the
Museum of Natural History, and in 1809 propounded, in his Zoological
Philosophy, a theory of transmutation of species. His Natural History
of Invertebrate Animals (1815-22) was justly celebrated. He became
blind several years before his death, 18 Dec. 1829.

Lamborelle (Louis). Belgian author of books on The Good Old Times,
Brussels, 1874; The Apostles and Martyrs of Liberty of Conscience,
Antwerp, 1882, and other anti-clerical works. Lamborelle lost a post

council of the Belgian Freethought party.

Lamettrie (Julian Offray de). French physician and philosopher,
b. St. Malo, 25 Dec. 1709. Destined for the Church, he was educated
under the Jesuits at Caen. He, however, became a physician, studying
under Boerhaave, at Leyden. Returning to France, he became surgeon
to the French Guard, and served at the battles of Fontenoy and
Dettingen. Falling ill, he noticed that his faculties fluctuated with
his physical state, and drew therefrom materialistic conclusions. The
boldness with which he made his ideas known lost him his place, and he
took refuge in Holland. Here he published The Natural History of the
Soul, under the pretence of its being a translation from the English
of Charp [Sharp], 1745. This was followed by Man a Machine (1748),
a work which was publicly burnt at Leyden, and orders given for the
author's arrest. It was translated into English, and reached a second
edition (London, 1750). It was often attributed to D'Argens. Lamettrie
held that the senses are the only avenues to knowledge, and that it
is absurd to assume a god to explain motion. Only under Atheism will
religious strife cease. Lamettrie found an asylum with Frederick the
Great, to whom he became physician and reader (Feb. 1748). Here he
published Philosophical Reflections on the Origin of Animals (1750),
translated Seneca on Happiness, etc. He died 11 Nov. 1751, and desired
by his will to be buried in the garden of Lord Tyrconnel. The great
king thought so well of him that he composed his funeral eulogy.

b. Paris, 1588, was patronised by Louis XIV., and was preceptor to
the Duke of Anjou. Published The Virtue of Pagans and Dialogues
after the Manner of the Ancients, in which he gave scope to his
scepticism. Two editions of his collected works appeared, but neither
of these contains The Dialogues of Orasius Tubero (Frankfort 1606,
probably a false date). Died 1672.

Lancelin (Pierre F.), French materialist, b. about 1770. Became a
constructive engineer in the French navy, wrote an able Introduction
to the Analysis of Science, 3 vols. 1801-3, and a physico-mathematical

served as a volunteer colonel in the Spanish Army against Napoleon
from 1808 to 1814, besides devoting a considerable sum of money to
the Spanish cause. He became a resident of Florence about 1816. His
reputation chiefly rests on his great Imaginary Conversations, in
which many bold ideas are presented in beautiful language. Landor
was unquestionably the greatest English writer of his age. While
nominally a Christian, he has scattered many Freethought sentiments
over his various works. Died at Florence, 17 Sept. 1864.

Lanessan (Jean Louis de), French naturalist, b. at Saint Andre de

he was elected Deputy for the Department of the Seine. He founded
Le Reveil, edited the Marseillaise, and started the International
Biological Library, to which he contributed a study on the doctrine

Meyer (Lodewijk), a Dutch physician, a friend and follower of
Spinoza, who published Exercitatio Paradoxa on the philosophical
interpretation of scripture, Eleutheropoli (Amst.), 1666. This has
been wrongly attributed to Spinoza. It was translated into Dutch

on the relation of Herbert Spencer to German philosophy.

Middleton (Conyers), Freethinking clergyman, b. York 1683. His Letters
from Rome, 1729, showed how much Roman Christianity had borrowed from
Paganism, and his Free Inquiry into the Miraculous Powers supposed
to have subsisted in the Christian Church, 1749, was a severe blow
to hitherto received "Christian Evidences." He also wrote a classic
Life of Cicero. Died at Hildersham near Cambridge, 28 July, 1750.

Mignardi (G.), Italian writer, who in 1884 published Memorie di un
Nuovo Credente (Memoirs of a New Believer).

he was elected to Parliament for Westminster, but lost his seat in

"Nature," "Theism," and "Religion."

castle in Perigord, 28 Feb. 1533. He studied law and became a judge
at Bordeaux about 1554. In 1580 he produced his famous "Essays,"
which indicate a sprightly humor allied to a most independent
spirit. The Essays, Hallam says, make in several respects an epoch in
literature. Emerson says, "Montaigne is the frankest and honestest
of all writers." Montaigne took as his motto: Que scais-je? [What
know I?] and said that all religious opinions are the result of
custom. Buckle says, "Under the guise of a mere man of the world,
expressing natural thoughts in common language, Montaigne concealed a
spirit of lofty and audacious inquiry." Montaigne seems to have been
the first man in Europe who doubted the sense and justice of burning
people for a difference of opinion. His denunciation of the conduct of
the Christians in America does him infinite honor. Died 13 Sept. 1592.

the French Academy, though opposed by Cardinal Fleury on the ground
that his writings were dangerous to religion. His chief work is the
Spirit of Laws, 1748. This work was one of the first-fruits of the
positive spirit in history and jurisprudence. The chapters on Slavery
are written in a vein of masterly irony, which Voltaire pronounced

Moral Philosopher, 1737. Was a Presbyterian, but was deposed for
Arianism about 1723, and practised medicine at Bristol. He edited
Radicati's Dissertation on Death, 1731. His Moral Philosopher seeks
to substitute morality for religion. He calls Moses "a more fabulous
romantic writer than Homer or Ovid," and attacks the evidence of
miracles and prophecy. This was supplemented by A Further Vindication
of Moral Truth and Reason, 1739, and Superstition and Tyranny
Inconsistent with Theocracy, 1740. He replied to his opponents over
the signature "Philalethes." His last work was on Physico-Theology,

the founders of the Fortnightly Review, in which he wrote, as well as
in the Athenaeum. He contributed monographs on Gibbon and Macaulay to
Morley's "Men of Letters" Series. In '86 he published his striking work
The Service of Man, an Essay towards the Religion of the Future, which
shows that the benefits of Christianity have been much exaggerated and
its evils palpable. All his writings are earnest and thoughtful. He
collected books and studied to write a History of France, which would
have been a noble contribution to literature; but the possession of
a competence seems to have weakened his industry, and he never did
justice to his powers. Even the Service of Man was postponed until
he was no longer able to complete it as he intended. Morison was a
brilliant talker, and the centre of a wide circle of friends. George
Meredith dedicated to him a volume of poems. Died at Hampstead,
26 Feb. 1888.

at New Lanark Mills, where he built the first infant schools and
improved the dwellings of the workmen. From 1810-15 he published New
Views on Society, or, Essays on the Formation of Character. In '17 he
caused much excitement by proclaiming that the religions of the world
were all false, and that man was the creature of circumstances. In
'24 he went to America and purchased New Harmony, Indiana, from the
Rappists to found a new community, but the experiment was a failure,
as were also others at Orbiston, Laner, and Queenswood, Hants. In
'28 he debated at Cincinatti with Alex. Campbell on the Evidences of
Christianity. He published a numerous series of tracts, Robert Owen's
Journal, and The New Moral World, '35. He debated on his Social
System with the Rev. J. H. Roebuck, R. Brindley, etc. As his mind
began to fail he accepted the teachings of Spiritism. Died Newton,

the direction of social amelioration, and he is justly respected for
his energy, integrity and disinterested philanthropy.

Owen (Robert Dale), son of the above, b. Glasgow 9 Nov. 1800. Was
educated by his father till 1820, when he was sent to Fellenberg's
school, near Berne, Switzerland. In '25 he went to America to aid

failure of that experiment he began with Frances Wright, in Nov. '28,
the publication of the Free Inquirer, which was continued till
'32. In that year he had a written discussion with O. Bachelor on

ably championed the Freethought cause. He wrote a number of tracts

'67, advocating Darwinian views, made some stir in Scotland. He
became professor of geology at Durham University. A friend of Robert

of Creation, in the scientific details of which he assisted. Died at
Newcastle-on-Tyne, 9 March, 1879.

Paine (Thomas), Deist, b. Thetford, Norfolk, 29 Jan., 1737. His father
was a Quaker and staymaker, and Paine was brought up to the trade. He
left home while still young, went to London and Sandwich, where he
married the daughter of an exciseman, and entered the excise. He
was selected by his official associates to embody their wants in a
paper, and on this work he displayed such talent that Franklin, then
in London, suggested America as a good field for his abilities. Paine
went in 1774, and soon found work for his pen. He became editor of the
Pennsylvanian Magazine and contributed to the Pennsylvanian journal
a strong anti-slavery essay. Common Sense, published early in 1776,
advocating absolute independence for America, did more than anything
else to precipitate the great events of that year. Each number of
the Crisis, which appeared during the war, was read by Washington's
order to each regiment in the service. Paine subscribed largely
to the army, and served for a short time himself. After peace was
declared, congress voted him three thousand dollars, and the state
of New York gave him a large farm. Paine turned his attention to
mechanics, and invented the tubular iron bridge, which he endeavored
to introduce in Europe. Reaching France during the Revolution,
he published a pamphlet advocating the abolition of royalty. In
1791 he published his Rights of Man, in reply to Burke. For this
he was outlawed. Escaping from England, he went to France, where he
was elected to the Convention. He stoutly opposed the execution of
the king, and was thrown by Robespierre into the Luxembourg prison,
where for nearly a year he awaited the guillotine. During this time
he wrote the first part of the Age of Reason, which he completed
on his release. This famous book, though vulnerable in some minor
points of criticism, throws a flood of light on Christian dogmas,
and has had a more extended sale than any other Freethought work. As
a natural consequence, Paine has been an object of incessant slander
by the clergy. Paine died at New York 8 June, 1809, and, by his own
direction was buried on his farm at New Rochelle. Cobbett is said to
have disinterred him and brought his bones to England.

the Mortality of the Soul--modeled on Lucretius. He was Professor
of Eloquence at Milan for ten years, but was accused of heresy. He
had called the Inquisition a poignard directed against all men of

to have occasioned its suppression.

Parker (Theodore), American rationalist, b. Lexington, Mass., 24
Aug. 1810. From his father--a Unitarian--he inherited independence
of mind, courage, and love of speculation. Brought up in poverty he
studied hard, and acquired a University education while laboring on the
farm. In March, '31, he became an assistant teacher at Boston. In June,
'37, he was ordained Unitarian minister. Parker gradually became known
as an iconoclast, and study of the German critics made him a complete
rationalist, so that even the Unitarian body rejected him. A society
was established to give him a hearing in Boston, and soon his fame
was established. His Discourse on Matters Pertaining to Religion,
'47, exhibited his fundamental views. He translated and enlarged
De Wette's Critical Introduction to the Old Testament. A fearless

Considered as Legislator and Moralist (1788) he did something for the
infant science of comparative religion. His principal work is a learned
History of Legislation, in 11 vols. (1817-37), in which he passes in
review all the ancient codes. He embraced the Revolution, and became
President of the Legislative Assembly (3 Oct. 1791). He proposed the
erection of the Column of July on the Place of the Bastille, and the
conversion of the church of Ste Genevieve into the Pantheon. On the
19th June, 1792, he presented a motion for the complete separation of
the state from religion. He fled during the Terror, but returned as
deputy in 1795. In 1820 he succeeded his friend Volney as member of
the French Academy, in '23 received the cross of the Legion of Honor,

the plaintiff's bad character. When released he went to Scotland to
uphold the right of free publication, and was sentenced 8 Nov. '43 to

of the Apostles' Creed. In 1457 he was accused of heresy, recanted
from fear of martyrdom, was deprived of his bishopric, and imprisoned
in a monastery at Canterbury, where he used to repeat to those who
visited him,


            "Wit hath wonder, that reason cannot skan,
            How a Moder is Mayd, and God is Man."


His books were publicly burnt at Oxford. He died in 1460. His influence

Petronius, called Arbiter (Titus), Roman Epicurean poet at the Court
of Nero, in order to avoid whose resentment he opened his veins and
bled to death in A.D. 66, conversing meanwhile with his friends on the
gossip of the day. To him we owe the lines on superstition, beginning
"Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor." Petronius is famous for his "pure
Latinity." He is as plain-spoken as Juvenal, and with the same excuse,
his romance being a satire on Nero and his court.

Petruccelli della Gattina (Ferdinando) Italian writer, b. Naples,
1816, has travelled much and written many works. He was deputy to
the Naples Parliament in '48, and exiled after the reaction.

was also burnt in effigy in the public square of Padua.

Praeadamitae, 1653, in which he maintained that men lived before Adam,
made a great sensation, and was burnt by the hangman at Paris. The
bishop of Namur censured it, and la Peyrere was arrested at Brussels,
1656, by order of the Archbishop of Malines, but escaped by favor of
the Prince of Conde on condition of retracting his book at Rome. The
following epitaph was nevertheless made on him:


            La Peyrere ici git, ce bon Israelite,
            Hugenot, Catholique, enfin Pre-adamite:
            Quatre religions lui plurent a la fois:
              Et son indifference etait si peu commune
            Qu'apres 80 ans qu'il eut a faire un choix
              Le bon homme partit, et n'en choisit pas une.


Died near Paris, 30 Jan. 1676.

contributed to the Boston Investigator and Freethinkers' Magazine. His
principal work is Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles, 1883.

Piron (Alexis), French comic poet, b. Dijon, 9 July, 1689. His
pieces were full of wit and gaiety, and many anecdotes are told of
his profanity. Among his sallies was his reply to a reproof for being
drunk on Good Friday, that failing must be excused on a day when even
deity succumbed. Being blind in his old age he affected piety. Worried
by his confessor about a Bible in the margin of which he had written
parodies and epigrams as the best commentary, he threw the whole book
in the fire. Asked on his death-bed if he believed in God he answered
"Parbleu, I believe even in the Virgin." Died at Paris, 21 Jan. 1773.

are published in ten vols. Petersburg, 1870.

Pitt (William). Earl of Chatham, an illustrious English statesman
and orator, b. Boconnoc, Cornwall, 15 Nov. 1708. The services to his
country of "the Great Commoner," as he was called, are well known,
but it is not so generally recognised that his Letter on Superstition,
first printed in the London Journal in 1733, entitles him to be ranked
with the Deists. He says that "the more superstitious people are,
always the more vicious; and the more they believe, the less they
practice." Atheism furnishes no man with arguments to be vicious;
but superstition, or what the world made by religion, is the greatest
possible encouragement to vice, by setting up something as religion,
which shall atone and commute for the want of virtue. This remarkable
letter ends with the words "Remember that the only true divinity
is humanity."

Place (Francis), English Radical reformer and tailor; b. 1779 at
Charing Cross. He early became a member of the London, Corresponding
Society. He wrote to Carlile's Republican and Lion. A friend of
T. Hardy, H. Tooke, James Mill, Bentham, Roebuck, Hetherington, and
Hibbert (who puts him in his list of English Freethinkers). He was
connected with all the advanced movements of his time and has left

now in the British Museum. He always professed to be an Atheist--see
Reasoner, 26 March, '54. Died at Kensington, 1 Jan. 1854.

Pliny (Caius Plinius Secundus), the elder, Roman naturalist, b. Verona,
A.D. 22. He distinguished himself in the army, was admitted into the
college of Augurs, appointed procurator in Spain, and honored with
the esteem of Vespasian and Titus. He wrote the history of his own
time in 31 books, now lost, and a Natural History in 37 books, one
of the most precious monuments of antiquity, in which his Epicurean
Atheism appears. Being with the fleet at Misenum, 24 Aug. A.D. 79,
he observed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and landing to assist
the inhabitants was himself suffocated by the noxious vapors.

Plumacher (Olga), German pessimist, follower of Hartmann, and authoress
of a work on Pessimism in the Past and Future, Heidelberg, 1884. She
has also defended her views in Mind.

1759. In 1780 he became a Baptist preacher, but resigned on account
of scepticism. He remained a deist. He served in the Legislature
eight terms, during two of which he was Speaker. He was governor
of New Hampshire, 1812-18, wrote to the press over the signature
"Cincinnatus," and published an Address to the Clergy, '14. He lived
till 22 June, 1850.

Plutarch. Greek philosopher and historian, b. Cheronaea in Boetia, about
A.D. 50. He visited Delphi and Rome, where he lived in the reign of
Trajan. His Parallel Lives of forty-six Greeks and Romans have made
him immortal. He wrote numerous other anecdotal and ethical works,
including a treatise on Superstition. He condemned the vulgar notions
of Deity, and remarked, in connection with the deeds popularly ascribed
to the gods, that he would rather men said there was no Plutarch than
traduce his character. In other words, superstition is more impious
than Atheism. Died about A.D. 120.

Poe (Edgar Allan), American poet, grandson of General Poe, who figured
in the war of independence, b. Boston, 19 Jan. 1809. His mother was
an actress. Early left an orphan. After publishing Tamerlane and other
Poems, '27, he enlisted in the United States Army, but was cashiered in
'31. He then took to literary employment in Baltimore and wrote many
stories, collected as the Tales of Mystery, Imagination, and Humor. In
'45 appeared The Raven and other Poems, which proved him the most
musical and dextrous of American poets. In '48 he published Eureka,
a Prose Poem, which, though comparatively little known, he esteemed
his greatest work. It indicates pantheistic views of the universe. His
personal appearance was striking and one of his portraits is not
unlike that of James Thomson. Died in Baltimore, 7 Oct. 1849.

Poey (Andres), Cuban meteorologist and Positivist of French and Spanish
descent, b. Havana, 1826. Wrote in the Modern Thinker, and is author
of many scientific memoirs and a popular exposition of Positivism

Pomponazzi (Pietro) [Lat. Pomponatius], Italian philosopher,
b. Mantua, of noble family, 16 Sept. 1462. He studied at Padua,
where he graduated 1487 as laureate of medicine. Next year he was
appointed professor of philosophy at Padua, teaching in concurrence
with Achillini. He afterwards taught the doctrines of Aristotle at
Ferrara and Bologna. His treatise De Immortalitate Animae, 1516, gave
great offence by denying the philosophical foundation of the doctrine
of the immortality of the soul. The work was burnt by the hangman at
Venice, and it is said Cardinal Bembo's intercession with Pope Leo
X. only saved Pomponazzi from ecclesiastical procedure. Among his works
is a treatise on Fate, Free Will, etc. Pomponazzi was a diminutive
man, and was nicknamed "Peretto." He held that doubt was necessary
for the development of knowledge, and left an unsullied reputation
for upright conduct and sweet temper. Died at Bologna, 18 May, 1525,
and was buried at Mantua, where a monument was erected to his memory.

Ponnat (de), Baron, French writer, b. about 1810. Educated by

Porphyry, Greek philosoper of the New Platonic school, b. Sinia,
233 A.D. His original name was Malchus or Melech--a "King." He was
a pupil of Longinus and perhaps of Origen. Some have supposed that
he was of Jewish faith, and first embraced and then afterwards
rejected Christianity. It is certain he was a man of learning and
intelligence; the friend as well as the disciple of Plotinus. He wrote
(in Greek) a famous work in fifteen books against the Christians, some
fragments of which alone remain in the writings of his opponents. It
is certain he showed acquaintance with the Jewish and Christian
writings, exposed their contradictions, pointed out the dispute between
Peter and Paul, and referred Daniel to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes.
He wrote many other works, among which are lives of Plotinus and
Pythagorus. Died at Rome about 305.

Porzio (Simone), a disciple of Pomponazzi, to whom, when lecturing
at Pisa, the students cried "What of the soul?" He frankly professed
his belief that the human soul differed in no essential point from
the soul of a lion or plant, and that those who thought otherwise
were prompted by pity for our mean estate. These assertions are in
his treatise De Mente Humana.

"Posos (Juan de)," an undiscovered author using this pen-name,
expressed atheistic opinions in a book of imaginary travels, published
in Dutch at Amsterdam in 1708, and translated into German at Leipsic,

and, sharing their views, embraced the revolution with ardor, though
it ruined his fortunes. He wrote Philosophical Researches, 1786, edited
the posthumous works of D'Alembert, 1799, and worked at a dictionary of
the French language. His Jocko, a tale of a monkey, exhibits his keen
sympathy with animal intelligence, and in his Philosophical Letters,
1826, he gives anecdotes of Voltaire, Rousseau, D'Alembert, Pechmeja,
Franklin, etc. Died at Vauxbuin, near Soissons, 19 Dec. 1833.

is God? What is Man? a scientific solution of the religious problem
(Brussels, 1865), and re-issued as God According to Science, '75,

the only divinity is moral harmony.

Poultier D'Elmolte (Francois Martin), b. Montreuil-sur-Mer, 31
Oct. 1753. Became a Benedictine monk, but cast aside his frock
at the Revolution, married, and became chief of a battalion of
volunteers. Elected to the Convention he voted for the death of

Powell (B. F.), compiler of the Bible of Reason, or Scriptures of
Ancient Moralists; published by Hetherington in 1837.

Prades (Jean Martin de), French theologian b. Castel-Sarrasin, about
1720. Brought up for the church, he nevertheless became intimate with
Diderot and contributed the article Certitude to the Encyclopedie. On
the 18th Nov. 1751 he presented to the Sorbonne a thesis for the
doctorate, remarkable as the first open attack on Christianity by
a French theologian. He maintained many propositions on the soul,
the origin of society, the laws of Moses, miracles, etc., contrary
to the dogmas of the Church, and compared the cures recorded in the
Gospels to those attributed to Esculapius. The thesis made a great
scandal. His opinions were condemned by Pope Benedict XIV., and he
fled to Holland for safety. Recommended to Frederick the Great by
d'Alembert he was received with favor at Berlin, and became reader to
that monarch, who wrote a very anti-Christian preface to de Prades'
work on ecclesiastical history, published as Abrege de l'Histoire
ecclesiastique de Fleury, Berne (Berlin) 1766. He retired to a benefice
at Glogau (Silesia), given him by Frederick, and died there in 1782.

Leeds, 18 March, 1733. Brought up as a Calvinist, he found his way
to broad Unitarianism. Famous as a pneumatic chemist, he defended the
doctrine of philosophical necessity, and in a dissertation annexed to
his edition of Hartley expressed doubts of the immateriality of the
sentient principal in man. This doctrine he forcibly supported in
his Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit, 1777. Through the obloquy
these works produced, he lost his position as librarian to Lord
Shelburne. He then removed to Birmingham, and became minister of
an independent Unitarian congregation, and occupied himself on his
History of the Corruptions of Christianity and History of the Early
Opinions Concerning Jesus Christ, which involved him in controversy
with Bishop Horsley and others. In consequence of his sympathy with
the French Revolution, his house was burnt and sacked in a riot,
14 July, 1791. After this he removed to Hackney, and was finally
goaded to seek an asylum in the United States, which he reached in
1794. Even in America he endured some uneasiness on account of his
opinions until Jefferson became president. Died 6 Feb. 1804.

Pringle (Allen), Canadian Freethinker, author of Ingersoll in Canada,
1880.

1837. Educated at King's College, London, and at St. John's, Cambridge,
where he became B.A. in '60. In '66 he became Fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society, of which he afterwards became hon. sec. He
maintained in '69 the since-established theory of the solar corona. He
wrote, lectured, and edited, far and wide, and left nearly fifty
volumes, chiefly popularising science. Attracted by Newman, he was for
a while a Catholic, but thought out the question of Catholicism and
science, and in a letter to the New York Tribune, Nov. '75, formally
renounced that religion as irreconcilable with scientific facts. His
remarks on the so-called Star of Bethlehem in The Universe of Suns,
and other Science Gleanings, and his Sunday lectures, indicated his
heresy. In '81 he started Knowledge, in which appeared many valuable
papers, notably one (Jan. '87), "The Beginning of Christianity." He
entirely rejected the miraculous elements of the gospels, which he
considered largely a rechauffe of solar myths. In other articles
in the Freethinkers' Magazine and the Open Court he pointed out the
coincidence between the Christian stories and solar myths, and also
with stories found in Josephus. The very last article he published
before his untimely death was a vindication of Colonel Ingersoll
in his controversy with Gladstone in the North American Review. In
'84 he settled at St. Josephs, Mobille, where he contracted yellow
fever and died at New York, 12 Sep. 1888.

Proudhon (Pierre Joseph), French anarchist and political thinker,
b. Besancon, 15 Jan. 1809. Self-educated he became a printer,
and won a prize of 1,500 francs for the person "best fitted for a
literary or scientific career." In '40 appears his memoir, What is
Property? in which he made the celebrated answer "C'est le vol." In
'43 the Creation of Order in Humanity appeared, treating of religion,
philosophy and logic. In '46 he published his System of Economical
Contradictions, in which appeared his famous aphorism, "Dieu,
c'est le mal." In '48 he introduced his scheme of the organisation
of credit in a Bank of the People, which failed, though Proudhon
saw that no one lost anything. He attacked Louis Bonaparte when
President, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a fine
of 10,000 francs. On 2 Jan. '50 he married by private contract while
in prison. For his work on Justice in the Revolution and in the Church
he was condemned to three years' imprisonment and 4,000 francs fine in
'58. He took refuge in Belgium and returned in '63. Died at Passy,
19 Jan. 1865. Among his posthumous works was The Gospels Annotated,
'66. Proudhon was a bold and profound thinker of noble aspirations,
but he lacked the sense of art and practicability. His complete works
have been published in 26 vols.

Protagoras, Greek philosopher, b. Abdera, about 480 B.C. Is said to
have been a disciple of Democritus, and to have been a porter before
he studied philosophy. He was the first to call himself a sophist. He
wrote in a book on the gods, "Respecting the gods, I am unable to
know whether they exist or do not exist." For this he was impeached
and banished, and his book burnt. He went to Epirus and the Greek
Islands, and died about 411. He believed all things were in flux,
and summed up his conclusions in the proposition that "man is the
measure of all things, both of that which exists and that which does
not exist." Grote, who defends the Sophists, says his philosophy "had
the merit of bringing into forcible relief the essentially relative
nature of cognition."

called the Russian Byron, b. Pskow, 26 May, 1799. From youth he
was remarkable for his turbulent spirit, and his first work, which
circulated only in manuscript, was founded on Parny's Guerre des
Dieux, and entitled the Gabrielade, the archangel being the hero. He
was exiled by the Emperor, but, inspired largely by reading Voltaire
and Byron, put forward numerous poems and romances, of which the most
popular is Eugene Oneguine, an imitation of Don Juan. He also wrote
some histories and founded the Sovremennik (Contemporary), 1836. In
Jan. 1837 he was mortally wounded in a duel.

'47. After '52 he lived in England, where he wrote an apology for
the attempt of Orsini, published by Truelove, '58. In '71 he founded
the journal le Combat. Elected to the National Assembly he protested
against the treaty of peace, was named member of the Commune and
condemned to death in '73. He returned to France after the armistice,
and has sat as deputy for Marseilles. Died, Saint Gerainte near Nice,

Pyrrho. Greek philosopher, a native of Elis, in Peloponesus, founder of
a sceptical school about the time of Epicurus; is said to have been
attracted to philosophy by the books of Democritus. He attached himself
to Anaxarchus, and joined her in the expedition of Alexander the Great,
and became acquainted with the philosophy of the Magi and the Indian
Gymnosophists. He taught the wisdom of doubt, the uncertainty of all
things, and the rejection of speculation. His disciples extolled his
equanimity and independence of externals. It is related that he kept
house with his sister, and shared with her in all domestic duties. He
reached the age of ninety years, and after his death the Athenians
honored him with a statue. He left no writings, but the tenets of his
school, which were much misrepresented, may be gathered from Sextus
and Empiricus.

temper, quitted the convent without the leave of his superior. He
studied medicine at Montpelier about 1530, after which he practised
at Lyons. His great humorous work, published anonymously in 1535, was
denounced as heretical by the clergy for its satires, not only on their
order but their creed. The author was protected by Francis I. and was

had great success, and Emilius (May 1762), a moral romance, in which
he condemns other education than that of following nature. In this

became an actor and produced his marvellous plays, the eternal honor
of English literature. Shakespeare gained wealth and reputation and
retired to his native town, where he died April 23, 1616. His dramas
warrant the inference that he was a Freethinker. Prof. J. R. Green
says, "Often as his questionings turned to the riddle of life
and death, and leaves it a riddle to the last without heeding the
common theological solutions around him." His comprehensive mind
disdained endorsement of religious dogmas and his wit delighted in

also forbade him his house. He went to London, wrote Queen Mab, and
met Miss Westbrook, whom, in 1811, he married. After two children
had been born, they separated. In '16 Shelley learned that his wife
had drowned herself. He now claimed the custody of his children,
but, in March, '17, Lord Eldon decided against him, largely on
account of his opinions. Shelley had previously written A Letter
to Lord Ellenborough, indignantly attacking the sentence the judge
passed on D. I. Eaton for publishing Paine's Age of Reason. On 30
Dec. '16, Shelley married Mary, daughter of William Godwin and Mary
Wollstonecraft. In '18, fearing their son might also be taken from him,
he left England never to return. He went to Italy, where he met Byron,
composed The Cenci, the Witch of Atlas, Prometheus Unbound, Adonais,
Epipsychidion, Hellas, and many minor poems of exquisite beauty,
the glory of our literature. He was drowned in the Bay of Spezzia,

Spinoza (Baruch), Pantheistic philosopher, b. of Jewish parents,
Amsterdam, 24 Nov. 1632. He early engaged in the study of theology and
philosophy, and, making no secret of his doubts, was excommunicated
by the Synagogue, 27 July, 1656. About the same time he narrowly
escaped death by a fanatic's dagger. To avoid persecution, he retired
to Rhinsburg, and devoted himself to philosophy, earning his living by
polishing lenses. About 1670 he settled at the Hague, where he remained
until his death. In 1670 he issued his Tractatus Theologico-politicus,
which made a great outcry; and for more than a century this great
thinker, whose life was gentle and self-denying, was stigmatized as
an atheist, a monster, and a blasphemer. A re-action followed, with
Lessing and Goethe, upon whom he had great influence. Though formerly
stigmatized as an atheist, Spinoza is now generally recognised as
among the greatest philosophers. He died in poverty at the Hague,
