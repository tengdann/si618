breathing exercises.

From one to two glasses of water should be drunk at each of the above
meals. It may be taken hot if preferred. If something hot is desired,
as a beverage, take a cup of sassafras tea with a little cream and

p. 670.




MENUS FOR OBESITY


SPRING MENU

_OBESITY--IRREGULAR HEART ACTION NERVOUSNESS_


Fruit-juice, a glass of water, and ten minutes devoted to vigorous
exercise and deep breathing just after rising.


BREAKFAST

    Choice of fruit
    A cup of hot water
    Two or three exceedingly ripe bananas (red
    variety preferred), eaten with raisins, nuts, and
    cream

LUNCHEON

    A portion of fresh fish and a new baked potato

DINNER

    A green salad with dressing and nuts
    Peas or asparagus
    A rare omelet with a dash of grated nuts
    A bit of crisp corn bread or a bran meal gem

Most people afflicted with obesity are also afflicted with abnormal
appetite, therefore at the outset they may undergo some deprivation,
but if this is not yielded to, hunger will soon become normal.

The appetite for an excessive quantity of food is very much like the
appetite for coffee, intoxicants, or tobacco, and when the appetite
once becomes abnormal and is not held under control, either obesity or
chronic autointoxication will be the result.

Luncheon should be omitted unless very hungry.


SUMMER MENU

_OBESITY--IRREGULAR HEART ACTION NERVOUSNESS_

BREAKFAST

    Melon, peaches, or berries
    Tender fish, broiled
    A new potato or a bran muffin

LUNCHEON

    Corn or beans
    A salad--lettuce or celery

DINNER

    A light soup--vegetable
    Eggplant, okra, beans, or squash
    Bran gems or a potato
    Nuts, with a lettuce salad


FALL MENU

_OBESITY--IRREGULAR HEART ACTION NERVOUSNESS_

/First Day/: Immediately on rising, drink a cup of hot water,
followed by a cup of cool water. Devote as much time as possible (from
three to ten minutes) to such exercises as can be endured. (See Vol. V,
pp. 1343 to 1346.) Inflate lungs to their utmost capacity every third
or fourth movement.

Secure a spirometer and increase the lung capacity until it registers
about two hundred and fifty cubic inches. This is exceedingly important.

BREAKFAST

    A cantaloup or soaked, evaporated peaches
    Baked chestnuts
    Bananas with cream
    Bran meal gems

LUNCHEON

    A salad
    Carrots, squash, beets, parsnips, or turnips
    A potato or lima beans

SUPPLEMENTARY LUNCHEON

    (To be taken in office)

    Two exceedingly ripe bananas, with nut butter
    and raisins
    Two glasses of water

    (Or the following at a restaurant or cafe)

    Choice of the following vegetables--boiled onions,
    carrots, parsnips, squash, or tender corn
    A baked potato
    A glass of water

DINNER

    Choice of two vegetables from the selection
    given for luncheon
    A green salad
    A baked sweet or a white potato
    Two egg whites and one yolk very lightly
    poached
    Two glasses of water

Devote about ten minutes to exercising and deep breathing just before
retiring.

/Second Day/: The same as the first, slightly increasing or
decreasing the quantity of food according to normal hunger. It will
probably be necessary to draw a very sharp distinction between appetite
and hunger. (See Spring Menu, "No Appetite," p. 1081.)

/Third Day/: The same as the first, if entirely agreeable.

If the bowels should become too lax, a small portion of rice, cooked
in milk, might be taken with both the morning and the evening meal,
omitting a similar quantity of other foods.

/Fourth Day/:

BREAKFAST

    Two eggs, whipped from five to eight minutes,
    into which whip a rounded teaspoonful of sugar,
    and a dessert-spoonful of lemon juice
    Half a glass of water

LUNCHEON

    A vegetable salad, with a few nuts
    A baked sweet potato
    (These two articles should compose the entire
    meal)

DINNER

    Spinach (cooked), or a salad of lettuce and
    celery with English walnuts, masticated infinitely
    fine
    Choice of one or two fresh vegetables, including
    a small, baked white potato

/Fifth Day/: The same as the fourth.

/Sixth Day/: The same as the first, repeating the diet for about
two weeks.


WINTER MENU

_OBESITY--IRREGULAR HEART ACTION NERVOUSNESS_

/First Day/: Immediately after rising, drink a glass of cool
water, and the juice of a sweet orange. Devote as much time as possible
(five to ten minutes) to vigorous exercises.


BREAKFAST

    A cup of hot water

    Two egg whites and one yolk very lightly
      poached
    A small, baked white potato, with butter; eat
      skins and all

      minutes

/Note/: If the quantity seems insufficient, a corn-meal muffin
may be eaten.


LUNCHEON

    Boiled onions, carrots, or turnips
    A baked potato--eat skins and all
    One egg boiled two minutes


DINNER

    Celery, endive, or lettuce, with nuts or a simple
      dressing
    Turnips, carrots, spinach, boiled onions--any
      two of these
    A baked white potato, served hot with butter
      and salt
    A portion of wheat bran cooked five minutes
    A portion of gelatin, with thin cream

Just before retiring, devote from three to five minutes to exercising.
Drink a glass of water, take a spoonful or two of wheat bran, and
either a few California grapes or the juice of an orange.

/Second Day/: The same as the first, slightly varying the meals
by choosing different vegetables from the following selections:

    Beans                          Potatoes
    Beets                          Pumpkin
    Cabbage                        Spinach
    Carrots                        Squash
    Onions                         Turnips
    Parsnips

/Third Day/: The same as the second, adding one very ripe
banana, eaten with thin cream and raisins, to the morning meal, and a
few nuts, if desired.

Banana, nut butter, raisins, and cream make a delicious combination.
The entire breakfast could be made of these with good results.

/Fourth Day/: Exercise, water-drinking, and deep breathing just
before retiring and just after rising, as prescribed for the first day.


BREAKFAST

    A few Malaga grapes or a sweet orange
    Two exceedingly ripe bananas, eaten with
      thin cream and nut butter
    A cup of junket, or a small portion of gelatin
      with a very little sugar and thin cream
    One egg prepared as per recipe in "Introduction
      to Menus" if the appetite will accept it.
    (See p. 678.)


LUNCHEON

    A green salad
    A small portion of fish or chicken
    A baked potato
    A cup of hot water


DINNER

    One or two fresh vegetables--choice
    A glass of buttermilk with a small piece of
      corn bread
    A small portion of gelatin with thin cream

If the bowels are not normal, a portion of wheat bran should be taken
at the morning and the evening meal.

Both digestion and assimilation of food can be largely increased by
daily taking exercise No. 3 (see Vol. V, p. 1344), vigorously, for ten
or fifteen minutes just after rising and just before retiring.

/Fifth Day/: Same as the fourth, slightly increasing or
decreasing the quantity of food according to hunger.

/Sixth Day/: Same as the first, repeating, for a period of two
or three weeks, the menus as given, varying the meals by choosing
different vegetables in the same class as those prescribed.

      or a dish of very ripe          One whole egg
      berries, with sugar only        A bran meal gem or a small
    Two very ripe bananas               portion of corn bread
      eaten with thin cream,          One extremely ripe banana
      dates, and nuts, masticated       with figs, thin cream, and
      exceedingly fine                  nuts
    Two glasses of water or a
      cup of thin cocoa


LUNCHEON

    A lettuce and tomato salad,       One very ripe banana
      with nuts                       A spoonful or two of nuts
    One vegetable--fresh peas,        One or two figs, or two
      beans, spinach, or onions         dates
    One very small, baked             One glass of water
      potato
    One glass of water

    A salad of lettuce and tomatoes          A salad

      beans, beets,                            and served in the pod
      onions, peas                           A baked white potato
    A small, baked potato
    A very small portion of fish,
      or white meat of chicken

Menus No. 1 are slightly heavier than Menus No. 2. Choice may be
exercised between them, according to hunger, or according to activity
or amount of work done.

One glass of water should be drunk at each of the dinner meals.

Two or three tablespoonfuls of wheat bran should be taken twice a week
with both the morning and the evening meal. The bran should be cooked
five minutes, and eaten with a spoonful of cream.


SUMMER MENU

_ABNORMAL APPETITE OBESITY--DROWSINESS_


    MENU I                             MENU II


BREAKFAST

    A cantaloup                        Two or three very ripe
    One exceedingly ripe red             peaches with sugar and
      banana, eaten with nut             cream
      butter; masticate very           A cantaloup
      fine                             Bran gems or whole wheat
    Three egg whites and one
      yolk, poached lightly,
      eaten with corn or a
      small potato


LUNCHEON

    A lettuce and tomato salad,        Two glasses of buttermilk
      eaten with nuts                  Onions, en casserole

      fresh fish                       An egg, with cooked spinach,
    A small, baked potato                or a small portion
    Green corn                           of green salad
    Spinach and corn, cooked

From one to two glasses of water should be drunk at each of these meals.

The accumulation of gas after meals can be largely controlled by
extreme mastication, very slow, deliberate eating, and copious
water-drinking at meals.

If constipated, take, immediately on rising and just before retiring,
a half pound of grapes, swallowing the skins, seeds and pulp. Do not
masticate the seeds or pulp. If preferred, half a cup of coarse wheat
bran may be taken twice daily instead of grapes.

If the bowels should become slightly lax, the seeds of the grapes
should be omitted at night.

Health is Nature's gift to the young; after that, it is a thing that
must be earned.


FALL MENU

_ABNORMAL APPETITE OBESITY--DROWSINESS_


/First Day/:


BREAKFAST

    One glass of water
    A melon
    Two or three extremely ripe peaches
    Three egg whites, poached very lightly
    A bran meal gem
    One exceedingly ripe red banana (must be black
      spotted), with nut butter and thin cream


LUNCHEON

    One egg, whipped, mixed with a large glass of
      milk (A half hour later, eat two or three exceedingly
      ripe peaches)


DINNER

    Half a glass of water
    Half a cantaloup
    A lettuce and tomato salad
    Two medium ears of tender corn
    A small portion of tender fish

/Note/: I would advise a spirometer for measuring the capacity
of the lungs. The normal lung capacity for a man 5 feet 7 to 10 inches
in height should be about 300 cubic inches, and for a woman 5 feet 3
inches, 180 to 200 cubic inches. The ability to use surplus food, which
the appetite will continue to demand for some time, will depend upon
the amount of exercise and deep breathing taken, and the consequent
lung capacity.

/Second Day/: Same as the first, slightly increasing the
quantity of food taken at each meal, if demanded by /Normal
Hunger/.


/Third Day/:


BREAKFAST

    One glass of water
    Choice of melon, peaches, or plums
    An exceedingly ripe banana, eaten with thin
      cream
    One whole egg, or a small piece of broiled fish
    A very small baked potato--sweet or white


LUNCHEON

    One or two glasses of buttermilk
    An ear of corn


DINNER

    One glass of water
    A small ear of tender corn--boiled
    Choice of fresh green beans or tender lima beans
    Spinach, or a salad or anything green
    A very small portion of broiled fish (If preferred,
      chicken may be eaten at this meal)
    A baked potato

Just before retiring, eat a few peaches or some grapes.

If sleepy or drowsy after meals, devote from one to two minutes to
exercises Nos. 3 and 5 (see Vol. V, pp. 1344 and 1345), together with
deep breathing, before an open window or in the fresh air.

/Fourth Day/: Same as the third.

/Fifth Day/: Same as the first, repeating these menus for
about thirty days, making such variations in vegetables and fruits as
demanded by normal hunger.

These menus will seem insufficient in quantity measured by appetite,
but appetite, which comes from irritation of the mucous surface of the
stomach, is not a safe guide.

See menus for "No Appetite," p. 1081.

The greatest difficulty will be experienced the first week. After that,
nature will begin her process of adjustment, and the patient will
begin to reduce in weight and gain in strength; sleep will become more
restful and the sleepy and drowsy feeling after meals will gradually
disappear.

The following natural laws should be rigidly observed:

    1 Limit the quantity of food to the actual needs of the body

    2 Thorough and complete mastication

    3 An abundance of deep breathing

    4 A given amount of vigorous exercise every day

COLDS


[Sidenote: Cause 1]

A cold, in its last analysis, is merely a form of congestion
throughout the capillary vessels of the body. It may have been caused
by exposure--a draft of cold air blowing upon some exposed part
of the body, in which case Nature closes the pores of the skin in
self-defense. The poisons that are constantly being eliminated through
the pores are thus prevented from escaping through these channels, and
are picked up by the circulation, and carried to the lungs to be burned
with oxygen. The lung capacity being too limited, or the amount of
poison too great, Nature suppurates these poisons and throws them off
in the form of mucus.

[Sidenote: Cause 2]

When a quantity of food, greater than the body can use, is taken and
ingested into the circulation, the excess is carried to the lungs in
the same manner as above described, and the same form of congestion
and elimination takes place; therefore, colds caused by _exposure_
and _overeating_ are alike in every respect except their origin. The
experience of the writer has been that congestion, which we term colds,
is caused much more frequently from overeating than from exposure.

The logical remedy in either case is to limit the quantity of food to
the minimum and to confine the diet, as nearly as possible, to readily
soluble and readily digestible foods, such as nuts, fruit salads,
and fresh watery vegetables, taking only sufficient nitrogenous and
carbohydrate compounds to balance the daily bill of fare.

The following menus given for colds may be also used in cases of la
grippe, influenza, etc.:




MENUS FOR COLDS

    A cup of hot water
    An apple, with nuts or berries, in season

NASAL CATARRH

The following menus, in their various groups, are composed of the most
easily digested foods that will give to the body all the elements of
nourishment it requires, during the several seasons of the year.

The calories of energy, remedial elements and counteractive properties
these menus contain, have been very carefully compiled from long
experience in the treatment of catarrh. The nutritive factors they
contain are proportioned or leveled so that under ordinary conditions
there will be no deficiency to produce unnatural craving, and no
surplus to be decomposed and converted into mucous or catarrhal
discharges.

These menus contemplate a normal body, living under normal conditions.
If one should be exposed to excessive cold, the carbohydrates (sugar
and starches) and fats may be slightly increased, and if exposed to
excessive heat these articles should be limited somewhat below the
amount prescribed. If one is engaged in heavy manual labor the proteid
factor such as is contained in beans, eggs, fish, and cheese may be
increased, and if performing no labor, these things should be reduced
even below the amount prescribed.

These menus will have a tendency to establish normal digestion and
assimilation of food, and normal elimination of waste. When this is
accomplished, the instincts and various senses will suggest the quality
and the quantity of food, the kind and amount of exercise, and all
other natural laws that govern and control the physical organism.


WATER-DRINKING IN THE TREATMENT OF NASAL CATARRH

Sufficient water should be drunk at each of these meals to bring the
moisture up to about 66 per cent of the whole. This will require from
one to three ordinary glasses, depending largely upon the amount of
residual water in the foods composing the meal.

See "Uses of Water in the Body," Lesson II, Vol. I, p. 53.

See also "Water-drinking in Cases of Superacidity," Vol. II, p. 434.

Water performs another very valuable service. When one eats too
many sweets, he should drink an abundance of water. This prevents
stomach-acidity, and consequent fermentation and irritation of the
mucous lining of the stomach. It also prevents torpidity of the liver,
which usually follows the excessive use of sweets.

Two or three glasses of water taken at an ordinary meal will all be
retained and used by the body, while the same quantity of water taken
from two to three hours after a meal, will nearly all pass off in the
form of urine.




MENUS FOR NASAL CATARRH


LATE SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER

_NASAL CATARRH_

Sweet orange, cherries, or very ripe grapefruit just after rising.


BREAKFAST

    Three or four egg whites, whipped five minutes,
      to which add two teaspoonfuls each of lemon juice
      and sugar, while whipping

      sugar and of lemon juice

These menus are composed largely of proteids in their most soluble
and digestible forms--a most important factor in remedial feeding,
especially in cases of either stomach or nasal catarrh.

One or two glasses of water should be drunk at each of these meals.
Mastication should be perfect before any water is taken into the mouth.

The bowels should be kept normal by the use of wheat bran.

INFLUENZA

In treating influenza heavy starchy foods such as white flour products
should be omitted, and the diet confined largely to fresh vegetables
and the more soluble proteids, such as egg whites and buttermilk, with
now and then a limited quantity of fish or fowl for a change.

Fats and sugars should be limited very materially and a liberal
quantity of coarse articles such as wheat bran, celery, grapes, and
green salads eaten when in season.

The patient should exercise great care in regard to quantity,
endeavoring always to limit the quantity of food somewhat below the
demands of normal hunger.

The menus for colds, catarrh, hay fever, and asthma may be used for
influenza. See pp. 917 to 938, inclusive.




MENUS FOR INSOMNIA


SPRING MENU

_INSOMNIA--NERVOUSNESS_

_LOW VITALITY_

Both insomnia and nervousness are symptoms of the same conditions. The
following menus, therefore, are for the purpose of removing primary
causes, which are usually either stomach or intestinal fermentation.

The logical remedy for fermentation is to limit the diet to the fewest
number of articles that will give to the body the necessary elements of
nutrition.


BREAKFAST

    A cup of hot water
    Corn hominy or boiled wheat
    A banana, baked, or sliced and broiled in butter
    A cup of cool water


LUNCHEON

    A liberal portion of peas in the pod
    A baked potato


DINNER

    Light vegetable soup
    Peas or asparagus
    Baked potatoes
    A cup of hot water
    Half-cup of wheat bran, cooked

/Note/: New peas should be cooked in the pod, as the shell
contains better nutrition than the pea. For recipe, see p. 679.


SUMMER MENU

_INSOMNIA--NERVOUSNESS LOW VITALITY_


BREAKFAST

    Cantaloup or very ripe pear, with cream
    A baked sweet potato, with butter
    A pint of rich milk
    Wheat bran


LUNCHEON

    An ear or two of tender corn
    A green salad
    One egg, whipped


DINNER

    Lettuce and tomato salad, with grated nuts
    String beans, with raw onion
    Tender corn, scraped from the cob, cooked with
      very little rich milk and the white of an egg
    Cantaloup

The quantity of food prescribed is sufficient for one performing very
light labor. If the duties should be strenuous, the quantity may be
slightly increased, but the proportions and the combinations should be
observed.


FALL MENU

_INSOMNIA--NERVOUSNESS

LOW VITALITY_

Vigorous exercise, deep breathing, and a glass or two of water should
be taken on rising.


BREAKFAST


(Half hour later)

    Cantaloup, pears, or persimmons
    Baked bananas, served with cream
    Steamed figs, with thin cream
    A spoonful of nuts


LUNCHEON

    Corn on the cob or boiled wheat
    String beans
    Spinach


DINNER

    Romaine and tomato salad
    A liberal portion of baked white potato or
      tender corn
    Carrots or parsnips
    Cheese with hard cracker
    A cup of thin cocoa

If there should be congestion of the bowels, a liberal service of
Concord or blue grapes should be eaten the first thing after rising,
and the last thing before retiring. The pulp and seeds should be
swallowed, and the skins well masticated.


WINTER MENU

_INSOMNIA--NERVOUSNESS

LOW VITALITY_

A cup or two of hot water, deep breathing, and vigorous exercise
immediately after rising.


BREAKFAST

    Half a pound of Tokay or Malaga grapes, masticating
      and swallowing both skins and seeds
    Two fresh eggs, whipped very thoroughly,
      slightly sweetened with honey or maple-sugar,
      and flavored with fruit-juice. Add half a glass of
      milk to each egg and drink slowly


LUNCHEON

    A small portion of wheat bran, cooked
    A pint and a half of junket, taken slowly
    One bran meal gem


DINNER

    Carrots or winter squash
    A small portion of tender fish or a whipped egg
    A baked potato
    A cup of cool water

To increase vital energy depends not so much upon the quantity as
upon the amount of food ingested or assimilated. These menus are
rather light for one of low vitality, but they are made to meet
the requirements of one suffering from nervousness and insomnia.
If, however, these conditions do not prevail, the quantity may be
increased, but the combinations should be carefully observed.




MENUS FOR RHEUMATISM AND GOUT


SPRING MENU

_RHEUMATISM--GOUT--LUMBAGO SCIATICA, ARTHRITIS_


BREAKFAST

Choice of the following:

      _a_ Two or three bananas, baked; serve with
          cream or butter
      _b_ A baked sweet potato
    Half a dozen steamed figs, with cream


LUNCHEON

    Asparagus or peas
    A small portion of new potatoes--preferably
      baked


DINNER

    Potato, steamed wheat, or bran gems
    A glass of milk; buttermilk preferred
    One fresh vegetable, such as carrots, turnips,
      parsnips, or onions
    Nuts or cream cheese


A generous quantity of pure water should be drunk immediately on
rising, and from one to two glasses at each of these meals.

Mastication should be very thorough. At least two hours' vigorous
exercise or useful labor should be performed each day, in the open air.

Omit all acids, such as grapefruit, oranges, pineapples, lemons, and
rhubarb; also eggs and all flesh foods.

If the bowels are constipated, take a tablespoonful of wheat bran in
half a glass of hot water immediately on rising, and half a cup of
bran, cooked, at each meal; also, two or three tablespoonfuls in hot
water just before retiring. Continue this until the bowels become
normal, then reduce the quantity according to the severity of the case.


SUMMER MENU

_RHEUMATISM--GOUT--LUMBAGO_

_SCIATICA, ARTHRITIS_


BREAKFAST

    Melon or peaches--very ripe
    Two or three large, very ripe bananas, peeled,
      and baked ten minutes; serve with cream or
      fresh butter
    A bran meal gem


LUNCHEON

    A very small portion of green salad
    An ear or two of tender corn
    A pint of buttermilk


DINNER

    A small portion of green salad
    Peas, beans, corn, or any fresh vegetable
    A very small portion of fish (Buttermilk or junket
      may be taken instead of fish, if preferred)
    A baked potato
    Melon or cantaloup

From two to three glasses of water should be drunk at each of these
meals.

If the bowels are constipated, observe the instructions given for the
Spring Menu.

Exercise, in all rheumatic conditions, is very important, and while the
temperature of the summer weather aids in eliminating poisons from the
body, vigorous exercise should be taken in order to give Nature all the
help possible.

Rheumatism is merely a form of congestion throughout the capillary
vessels of the body. The cure, therefore, is first to remove the
causes by taking into the body only such foods as it will use, and use
completely; secondly, to aid Nature in casting out all poisons, thereby
establishing perfect elimination.


FALL MENU

_RHEUMATISM--GOUT--LUMBAGO_

BREAKFAST

    Melons or persimmons
    Whole wheat gems or bran gems
    An exceedingly ripe banana, with cream, nuts,
      and raisins

    Green corn or fresh string beans
    Either a baked potato or a very little whole
      wheat bread
    Two or three tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, with
      lettuce


DINNER

    Vegetable soup or cream soup
    Corn, lima beans, turnips, carrots, parsnips,
      squash, onions--any two of these

or two of lemon juice.

Devote as much time as possible (from three to five minutes) to

/First Day/: On rising, take two sweet, ripe plums, and a glass
of water. Devote from one to three minutes to exercises Nos. 3 and 5
(see Vol. V, pp. 1344 and 1345), and practise deep breathing, filling
the lungs to their utmost capacity every third or fourth movement. Also
take a short, brisk walk in the open air.


BREAKFAST


(An hour later)

    Four or five extremely ripe peaches, with just
      a sprinkle of sugar--no cream
    Two or three egg whites and one yolk, whipped
      with a teaspoonful of sugar
    One extremely ripe banana (black spotted),
      with nuts


LUNCHEON

    Two medium ears of tender green corn, thoroughly
      masticated; serve with either a very little
      nut butter or fresh dairy butter

    Cream of pea soup; crisp cracker--very little
    A lettuce and tomato salad, or cooked spinach
    An ear or two of tender green corn, or lima
      beans (cooked)
    A grilled sweet potato

Water should be taken as follows: Half a glass at the beginning, a
glass during the progress of the meal, and half a glass at the close.

Just before retiring, eat half a pound of very ripe grapes, swallowing
skins, seeds and pulps, or take four or five extremely ripe Japanese
plums, if they are not sweet and well ripened; grapes are preferred.

Devote about three minutes to exercises Nos. 3 and 5, together with
deep breathing.

/Second Day/: Same as the first, very slightly increasing the
quantity of food if there is the least symptom of weakness.

Every morning, immediately on rising, eat two or three peaches or
plums, and drink a glass of water.

/Third Day/:


BREAKFAST

    Cantaloup
    A cup of cocoa or chocolate
    Choice of:
      _a_ Two extremely ripe bananas, baked;
          serve with thin cream (bananas must
          be black spotted)
      _b_ A baked potato
    Two egg whites, whipped with a sprinkle of
      sugar and a little lemon juice and cream


LUNCHEON

    Tender corn
    String beans or squash
    Spinach or a green salad
    A cantaloup or two exceedingly ripe peaches,
      with a little sugar--no cream


DINNER

    A small portion of fish or white meat of chicken,
      provided there is a craving for this kind of food;
      if not, confine to
    Tender corn (One whole poached egg, eaten
      with the corn)
    One boiled onion or cooked spinach
    Two glasses of water

This entire meal should be masticated very thoroughly. This is one
method of preventing supersecretion of acid, premature fermentation and
the consequent accumulation of gas.

/Fourth Day/: The same as the third, with the exception of the
evening meal, which should consist of--

    A baked sweet potato--butter
    Carrots or string beans, or Spanish onion

/Fifth Day/: The same as the first.

/Sixth Day/: The same as the second, repeating the diet as given
for a week or ten days.

After the fourth day these meals may be slightly varied by choosing
from the following, where vegetables are prescribed:

    Beans                          Parsnips
    Beets                          Peas
    Carrots                        Squash
    Corn                           Turnips

The patient should retire at a reasonable hour, say 10 o'clock, and
rise about 6 or 6.30; have breakfast between 7.30 and 8; luncheon
between 12 and 1, and dinner not later than 6.30 or 7.

Masticate well every mouthful of food, whether it seems to need it
or not. Even bananas need much mastication, not for the purpose of
reduction, but for the purpose of insalivation. The same rule should
apply to all cooked vegetables and soft foods.

according to choice of vegetables, adhering closely, however, to the
number of eggs prescribed. If olive-oil is not pleasant to the taste,
it may be omitted, and a larger quantity of butter taken with the
potatoes. It would be well to take a tablespoonful of olive-oil just
before eating, followed by half a cup of hot water, especially if the
weather is cold.

    Two ears of tender corn
    Two glasses of milk
    One whipped egg
    A small portion of ice-cream
    Wheat bran


FALL MENU

_STOMACH TROUBLE--CONSTIPATION--INTESTINAL GAS--IRREGULAR HEART ACTION_

/First Day/: On rising, drink a cup or two of hot water, and
eat a half pound of grapes, the Concord or blue grapes preferred,
swallowing seeds and pulp whole, masticating and swallowing the
skins. Devote as much time as possible (from three to five minutes)
to deep breathing exercises before an open window, or in a thoroughly
ventilated room.


BREAKFAST


(Half an hour later)

    Half a cup of coarse wheat bran, served as an
      ordinary cereal
    A bowl of clabbered milk, with a sprinkle of
      maple-sugar
    Bran meal gems


LUNCHEON

    A glass of cool water
    Baked potatoes or corn
    One fresh vegetable, such as carrots, parsnips,
      turnips, beets, boiled onions, or squash

    A baked white potato--eat skins and all
    One egg white, or a very small portion of either
      fish or white meat of chicken; egg preferred

From one to two glasses of water should be drunk at each of these
meals--half a glass of cool water at the beginning of the meal, and
a cup of hot water at the close, would be sufficient; drink enough,
however, to make the total moisture about 66 per cent of the whole.

A tablespoonful of wheat bran should also be taken at each of the above
meals, either with a little water at the close of the meal, or cooked
and served as a cereal at the beginning of the meal. A spoonful or two
should be taken just after rising, and just before retiring, until the
bowels act normally, when the quantity may be regulated to meet the
severity of the condition.

/Second Day/: Same as the first.

/Third Day/: Same as the second, slightly increasing the food
if demanded by normal hunger, or decreasing it if there is a sense of
fullness after meals. It is always well to cease eating before hunger
is thoroughly satisfied. When the body is kept slightly hungry, it
assimilates all the food eaten, and insures natural digestion and
elimination of waste.

/Fourth Day/:


BREAKFAST

    One or two exceedingly ripe bananas, with
      cream and nut butter, and either raisins or
      soaked prunes
    A glass of milk

    Corn, fresh
    A glass of milk


DINNER

    Spinach, with egg white
    A very small portion of fish or white meat of
      chicken

A tablespoonful of olive-oil may be taken at the beginning of each of
these meals, and a cup of hot water at the close.

If the bowels have not become normal, continue taking the wheat bran
and grapes according to directions for the first day.

Observe the general rules of exercise and water-drinking just after
rising and just before retiring.

/Fifth Day/: Same as the fourth.

/Sixth Day/: Same as the first, repeating the diet herein given,
day by day, for two or three weeks.

    Baked potatoes, with butter. Eat skins and all
      (Make entire meal upon this)


DINNER

    Stewed pumpkin or winter squash
    Corn bread
    Choice of beans or a baked potato
    Wheat bran, cooked
    A glass of milk

Just before retiring, take a brisk walk for five minutes and practise

/Second Day/: Same as the first, slightly increasing or
decreasing the quantity of food to meet the demands of normal hunger.

/Third Day/:


BREAKFAST

    Prunes or dried peaches, stewed--no sugar
    One egg, whipped very fine
    Coarse cereal or wheat bran


LUNCHEON

    Liberal portion of baked sweet or white
      potatoes


DINNER

    Choice of two of the following vegetables:
      Beans          Onions
      Beets          Pumpkin
      Carrots        Squash
      Corn           Turnips
    A potato, prepared choice

/Fourth Day/: Same as the third, increasing or decreasing the
quantity of food according to hunger.

/Fifth Day/: Same as the first, repeating these menus for twelve
or fifteen days.

While the yolks of eggs are conducive to rheumatic tendencies, only
that portion, however, that is not naturally appropriated by the body
affect these conditions. In other words, it is the excess that is
harmful.

MENUS FOR CONSUMPTION

_WEAK LUNGS--CONSUMPTION_

For many centuries consumption, or the various forms of tuberculosis
have preyed upon the human race, yet science has so far failed to give
us one reliable artificial remedy. We must perforce turn to Nature, the
only remedy now known being oxygen or common air.

The consumptive or tubercular patient should provide some way to live
out-of-doors, day and night, winter and summer, unless the weather is
extremely cold.

The next important factor in treating this dis-ease is food.

The diet should consist of the richest and the most readily digestible
foods, in the following groups, given in the order of their importance:

    PROTEIDS      CARBOHYDRATES      FATS           FRUIT-SUGARS

    Eggs          Honey              Nuts           Figs         Oranges
    Milk          Maple-sugar        Olive-oil      Raisins      Pears
    Legumes       Whole wheat        Cream          Grapes       Plums
                  Rice               Butter         Persimmons   Peaches
                  Potatoes                          Bananas      Apples
                  Corn

    FRESH VEGETABLES             GREEN SALADS

    Asparagus     Beets          Lettuce
    Peas          Carrots        Romaine
    Beans         Parsnips       Parsley
    Green corn    Squash         Watercress
    Tomatoes      Celery
    Turnips
    Cabbage

The patient should drink an abundance of water, take vigorous exercise
and deep breathing, and eat liberally of grapes before breakfast, when
they are in season.

A spirometer should be secured, and an effort made to increase the
capacity of the lungs one cubic inch each day until their utmost
capacity has been reached.

The following menus are merely suggestive. They may be changed,
selecting the articles mentioned in the foregoing tables, when
available during the several seasons of the year:


GENERAL MENUS FOR WEAK LUNGS--CONSUMPTION

a breakfast cereal with butter or cream.


LUNCHEON

    Three eggs prepared as per recipe, p. 678; add
      two glasses of milk; mix well; drink slowly

    A baked white potato, rice, or corn
    One egg, prepared any way acceptable to the
      taste--preferably whipped

    Something green should be taken at this meal,
    if possible, such as lettuce, spinach, kale, parsley,
    or watercress

    Home-made ice-cream, in summer, or a tablespoonful
    of honey, in winter, may be eaten, if
    something sweet is desired

Drink from one to two glasses of water at each of these meals, but take
no water into the mouth until mastication is perfect.

Just before retiring, drink a glass of water, and eat half a pound
of grapes, then devote from ten to fifteen minutes to deep breathing
exercises.

/Second Day/: Same as the first, slightly increasing or
decreasing the quantity of food according to hunger.

Take an additional egg the second day for the noon meal; another the
third day, then gradually decrease the quantity if the appetite rebels
against them. Do not overeat. Assimilation is the primary object to be
obtained.

/Fourth Day/: On rising, drink water and eat grapes, as
prescribed for the first day. Devote much time to moderate exercise and
deep breathing.


BREAKFAST

    Two extremely ripe bananas, eaten with thin

    A large boiled onion, and a baked white potato,
      with butter and a dash of salt (If the onion cannot
      be procured, take carrots or parsnips)

If the bowels are not acting normally, drink a glass of water and take
a spoonful or two of wheat bran, after each meal.


DINNER

    A liberal portion of baked white potatoes, eaten
      with butter
    Four or five egg whites and two yolks, prepared
      as per recipe given for the first day
    A small portion of any two fresh vegetables
      (A little ice-cream may be taken at this meal, if
      there is a craving for something sweet)

/Fifth Day/: Same as the fourth, omitting ice-cream.

/Sixth Day/: Same as the first, repeating these menus for about
sixteen or eighteen days.

    One egg, cooked two minutes, eaten with the
      potato skins
    Fresh butter
    A cup of hot water at the close of the meal

DINNER

    Half a cup of wheat bran, cooked
    Two or three eggs, prepared as for breakfast
    One extremely ripe banana and a few soaked
      prunes
      (A very small, baked white potato may be taken
      if something salty is desired)
    A bunch of grapes

Just before retiring, eat a small bunch of grapes and drink a cup of
hot water. Devote from three to five minutes to exercises which have
already been prescribed for the morning.

These meals may be varied by changing the vegetables, and now and
then substituting for the eggs a portion of fresh fish or a glass of
buttermilk.

If the quantity of food prescribed does not seem sufficient, it might
be slightly increased; however, do not increase it beyond the limits
of normal hunger. The best combinations of food, when taken in excess
of the bodily needs, undergo a form of decomposition, and become a
prolific source of dis-ease.


WINTER MENU

_TUBERCULAR TENDENCY

CONSTIPATION--NERVOUSNESS--CATARRH_


BREAKFAST

    Two very ripe, red bananas, baked
    Nuts, cream, raisins
    Two whipped eggs; sugar; flavor to taste
    A spoonful of wheat bran


LUNCHEON

    Three fresh eggs, whipped about six minutes,
      with sugar; pineapple juice added after whipping
    A small portion of wheat bran, cooked


DINNER

    Celery
    A tablespoonful of olive-oil
    One fresh vegetable
    A potato
    Whole wheat bread (very little)
    Buttermilk or gelatin

The above menus have been selected and combined so as to counteract
constipation, catarrh, nervousness, biliousness, etc. There is no
specific remedy in foods for consumption. Foods will aid in curing
this dis-ease only through the natural process of building up healthy
tissue, and increasing the power of the body to resist all dis-eases.


SPRING MENU

_WEAK LUNGS_

_TENDENCY TOWARD INTESTINAL CONGESTION_

Immediately on rising drink a glass or two of water and take a very
little of some juicy fruit. Also take a brisk walk in the open air
before breakfast.


BREAKFAST

    The strained juice of one sweet orange, or a
      few very ripe berries, without cream
    Two or three coddled eggs
    A small whole wheat cracker
    One baked banana
    A spoonful of wheat bran


LUNCHEON

    A whole wheat muffin with butter, and a
      dessert-spoonful of honey
    A glass or two of milk
    Wheat bran


DINNER

    Bean soup or pea soup
    Peas, asparagus, spinach, or any fresh vegetable
    Corn bread or a very small portion of whole
      wheat
    One coddled egg
    A small portion of wheat bran, slightly cooked

From one to two glasses of water should be drunk at each of the above
meals.

If there is a marked tubercular tendency, from six to nine eggs may be
taken daily for about three days in each week, taking with the eggs
a small quantity of acid fruits at each meal--either orange juice,
berries, or a spoonful of strained pineapple juice. The acids should be
diluted (half water), and taken without sugar.


SUMMER MENU

_WEAK LUNGS_

_TENDENCY TOWARD INTESTINAL CONGESTION_

Take a brisk walk and deep breathing exercises before breakfast.


BREAKFAST

    A cantaloup or a pear
    Wheat bran, cooked
    A liberal portion of baked sweet potatoes
    One whole egg, either coddled or whipped
    A pint of sour milk or a cup or two of chocolate


LUNCHEON

    A liberal portion of tender corn, steamed in the
      husk
    A lettuce and tomato salad
    Nuts


DINNER

    String beans, corn, or carrots
    A baked potato
    A very small portion of tender fish, an egg, or
      clabbered milk
    Melon or peaches

If the patient is performing labor that would require more food than
herein prescribed, the quantity may be increased.


FALL MENU

_WEAK LUNGS_

_TENDENCY TOWARD INTESTINAL CONGESTION_

The following menus are laid out with the view of giving the greatest
amount of tissue-building food which require the least effort in
digestion.

There is nothing more valuable in the treatment of lung trouble than
extreme deep breathing. After pure blood is made, the way to keep it
pure is to keep it charged with oxygen, and the only way to do this is
to breathe an abundance of fresh air into the lungs.


BREAKFAST

    A bunch of grapes
    Three or four eggs, whipped five or six minutes,
      into which whip a teaspoonful of sugar, and a
      teaspoonful of Cognac brandy or lemon juice, to
      each egg

/Note/: The brandy is germicidal and aids in the digestion of
the egg yolks.


LUNCHEON

    From three to four eggs, prepared as for
      breakfast, slightly increasing the quantity of
      sugar and brandy. Put in a heaping teaspoonful
      of sugar and a dessert-spoonful of brandy, and add
      a full glass of milk to each egg


DINNER

    Any one or two fresh vegetables, including
    something green, as spinach or lettuce
    The fresh vegetables may consist of:
        A baked potato                 Squash
        Onions                         Turnips
        Parsnips

The patient may have a few grapes between meals and a few an hour after
dinner. He should swallow the seeds and pulp whole, and masticate and
swallow the skins. He should eat plenty of fresh eggs, fresh milk, and
ripe, sweet grapes. The milk and the eggs are good tissue-building
foods, while sugar is a carbohydrate and makes a good winter food. The
grapes are full of grape-sugar, which is an excellent nutrient, and
also an aid to the digestion of other foods.

/Note/: These menus were given to a consumptive patient, and
in a period of six weeks he had made a very substantial gain in both
weight and strength.


WINTER MENU

_WEAK LUNGS_

_TENDENCY TOWARD INTESTINAL CONGESTION_

Take a bit of fruit, a glass of water, and a brisk walk immediately
after rising.


BREAKFAST

    One or two exceedingly ripe bananas, baked,
      eaten with cream
    A service of corn hominy
    One coddled egg, if desired
    A cup of chocolate, or hot water, if preferred


LUNCHEON

    Vegetable soup
    One fresh vegetable; preferably boiled onion
      or carrots
    One or two glasses of fresh buttermilk
    Wheat bran


DINNER

    Celery, slaw, or any green salad
    Steamed rice or plain boiled wheat
    A whipped or coddled egg, or buttermilk
    Nuts and raisins

A small portion of wheat bran should be taken at breakfast and just
before retiring. Bran contains valuable mineral salts, and in winter
can replace the chemistry of green salads.

From one to two glasses of cool water should be drunk at each of these
meals.




MENUS FOR DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN


SPRING MENU

_ECZEMA_

Whether or not eczema is a dis-ease caused by bacteria, it is obvious
that the weapon with which to combat this disorder is pure blood with
an abundance of the white corpuscles. These phagocytes of the blood may
be properly called the police of the body.

The patient should observe the following general rules:

Drink an abundance of pure water both at meals and between meals. Omit
cane-sugar and all acids.

Dress as lightly as possible, and do not wear woolen garments next to
the skin.

Take sufficient vigorous exercise each day to cause perspiration. If
this cannot be done, the Turkish bath should be resorted to once a week.

Spend as much time in the open air as possible.

The meals should be substantially as follows:


BREAKFAST

    A few spoonfuls of wheat bran, cooked, and
      eaten with cream
    Two or three bran meal gems
    Two or three egg whites, whipped very thoroughly,
      to which add a spoonful of cream
    One ripe banana


LUNCHEON

    A green salad, with nuts--liberal portion
    A fresh vegetable; preferably boiled onions
      or carrots
    A baked potato


DINNER

    A salad of any green succulent plant
    Young onions
    Peas or asparagus
    A baked potato or baked beans


SUMMER MENU

_ECZEMA_


BREAKFAST

    Raspberries, blackberries, grapes, or cantaloup
    A potato--sweet or white
    A cup of cocoa or sassafras tea (See recipe,
      p. 681)


LUNCHEON

    Beets, asparagus, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels
      sprouts, or okra
    A potato--prepared choice


DINNER

    Two fresh vegetables; choice of:
        Asparagus                      Corn
        Beans                          Eggplant
        Beets                          Onions
        Carrots
    A very ripe peach or a cantaloup

Just before retiring, eat a few very ripe peaches, and take a
tablespoonful of wheat bran.


FALL MENU

_ECZEMA_

Either of the following menus may be chosen for a period of ten or
twenty days. They are designed especially for the removal of all
forms of autointoxication or self-poisoning which sometimes manifest
themselves by skin eruptions. While autointoxication may not be the
primary cause of eczema, it augments all zymotic conditions. The chief
purpose of these menus is to give to the body an opportunity to throw
off the dis-ease by removing all obstacles. I would therefore advise
that the use of tobacco, tea, coffee, and all alcoholic stimulants be
omitted.


    MENU I                             MENU II


BREAKFAST

    Two egg whites, whipped            Three extremely ripe bananas
      very thoroughly, adding            baked in a casserole
      a little heavy cream and           dish; serve with thin
      a spoonful of sugar                cream
        Take this as a sauce
        over two exceedingly
        ripe bananas,
        with nuts or nut
        butter
    A bunch of California
      grapes (Malagas)
    A cup of hot water at the
      beginning of the meal,
      and a glass of cool water
      at the close


LUNCHEON

    Spinach or a green salad           Squash or turnips
    String beans or corn               A salad (green)
    A potato                           Baked beans


DINNER

    A green salad or cooked            A small portion of fish,
      spinach                            white meat of chicken, or
    Boiled onions, carrots, or           an egg--egg preferred
      turnips                          A boiled onion and a baked
    A baked potato with fresh            potato
      butter                           A bit of green salad

From one to two glasses of water should be drunk at each of these
meals, preferably a cup of hot water at the beginning, and a glass of
cool water at the close. I would especially advise vigorous exercises
night and morning, and deep breathing before an open window.


WINTER MENU

_ECZEMA_

/First Day/: On rising, drink two or three glasses of water, eat
a few grapes, and devote from three to five minutes to any one of the
exercises shown in Vol. V, pp. 1343 to 1346, inclusive.


BREAKFAST

    Baked white potatoes or bran meal gems
    A glass of rich milk


LUNCHEON

    Baked beans
    Bermuda onions
    A potato or corn bread


DINNER

    Any two of the following:
        Beans                          Pumpkin
        Beets                          Squash
        Carrots                        Turnips
        Parsnips
    A green salad--either lettuce and tomatoes, or
      celery; very small portion
    A baked white potato--eat skins and all
    (A cup of very thin cocoa may be taken, if something
      hot is desired; however, pure water would
      be preferable)

Just before retiring, devote from three to four minutes to the
above-prescribed exercises. The lungs should be inflated to their
extreme capacity. Do not carry any of these exercises, however, to a
point beyond ordinary fatigue. Divide the exercise period, both night
and morning, into three or four two-minute heats.

Exercise and deep breathing are second in importance to diet, and
should be taken daily, night and morning.

Drink from one to two glasses of water at each meal, but do not take
water into the mouth until mastication is perfect.

/Second Day/: The same as the first, slightly increasing the
quantity of food until normal hunger is satisfied.

/Third Day/: Practically the same as the first, varying the
luncheon according to hunger. The luncheon may consist of any one or
two fresh vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, beets, baked white or
sweet potatoes.

/Fourth Day/:


BREAKFAST

    A cup of hot water
    A sweet potato or two bran meal gems
    Two or three tablespoonfuls of wheat bran,
      with thin cream


LUNCHEON

    Boiled onions
    A baked potato
    Choice of fish or an egg

Eat a pound of grapes ten minutes after this meal. The skins may
be eliminated, but swallow the seeds and pulp. If grapes cannot be
obtained, the juice of a sweet orange may be taken.


DINNER

    String beans or spinach, with egg, and a liberal
      piece of Bermuda or Spanish onion, uncooked
      (The onions and the beans should be made exceedingly
      hot with red pepper)
    A baked sweet or a white potato
    A small piece of corn bread, with one-half glass
      of buttermilk

From one to two glasses of water should be drunk at each of these meals.

Just before retiring, devote from three to five minutes to the
exercises prescribed for the first day.

/Fifth Day/: The same as the fourth, slightly increasing the
quantity of food if there is a return of normal hunger; if not,
continue to follow the diet as herein given, until natural hunger is
felt.

/Sixth Day/: The same as the first, repeating the diet from
eighteen to twenty days.


SPRING MENU

_WEAK DIGESTION--NERVOUSNESS_

_SLIGHT ECZEMA_

The following menus for spring, summer and fall are laid out on the
two-meal-a-day plan. In addition to the purposes named in the heading,
they are designed to promote vitality and endurance, thus enabling one
to meet the requirements of hot weather.

In order to aid the body in appropriating all the nourishment these
menus contain, one should take, each day, at least one hour's vigorous
exercise and deep breathing.

      of chicken

One or two glasses of water should be drunk at each of the dinner meals.

If constipated, two or three tablespoonfuls of wheat bran should be
taken about twice a week with both the morning and the evening meal.
This could be cooked five minutes, and may be made very palatable if
eaten with a spoonful of cream.

MENUS FOR THE PREGNANT WOMAN AND FOR THE NURSING MOTHER

IMPORTANCE OF FOOD DURING PREGNANCY

There is nothing so important, or that wields so much influence over
the comfort, the health, and the life of the pregnant woman as her
food, and there is nothing, perhaps, to which she gives so little
attention.

The diet of the prospective mother, of course, governs her digestion
and assimilation of food, and elimination of waste matter from the
body. These things control her health almost completely, and inasmuch
as all mental conditions are principally governed by health, the
intellectual faculties of the child are shaped largely by the condition
of the mother's digestion. It is obvious, therefore, that the health of
the mother and the entire future of the child depend more upon her diet
during pregnancy than upon any other one thing.

During pregnancy the prospective mother should avoid all such articles
of food as she would withhold from her baby after birth. This would
eliminate from her diet meat, condiments, sweets, especially pastries
and rich desserts; tea, coffee, and all stimulating and intoxicating
beverages.

The pregnant woman should balance her diet carefully as to the
proportion of proteids, carbohydrates, fats, and mineral salts.

As leading foods containing these nutrients, I would recommend the
following:


                                                          VEGETABLES

Some articles are listed under two headings. This is because they are
rich in both classes of nutrition.

The amount of grain products eaten by the prospective mother should
be somewhat limited, ranging between four and eight ounces a day,
governed by work or activity. Cereals, especially corn, rice, and oats,
are rich in phosphate of lime, which is the bone-making or structural
food. While enough of this should be eaten to give the child sufficient
bone-building material, too much makes birth difficult, and sometimes
fatal.

The following menus contain suggestions as to the selections,
combinations, and proportions of food that would compose a healthy bill
of fare for both mother and child for the several seasons of the year:

THE NURSING MOTHER


SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DIET

The nursing mother should omit all acid fruits, pickles, and condiments
containing vinegar. She should eat sparingly of sweets, especially of
the pastry and soda-fountain variety. She should omit such vegetables
as radishes, cucumbers, cabbage, and sourcrout.

Fresh corn and dried beans often produce serious intestinal trouble in
the young child. Eggs should never be eaten when there is the slightest
fever.

The diet of the nursing mother should be confined chiefly to the more
readily digestible foods such as are named in the menus which follow.


SUGGESTIONS FOR NURSING

The mother should remember that her baby should never be nursed when
she is tired, fatigued, overheated, angry, frightened, excited, or
laboring under any mental disturbance. Both her mental and her physical
condition are instantly conveyed to the child, through her milk, often
in exaggerated form. Children are sometimes thrown into convulsions by
nursing the breast of an excited mother.


SUGGESTIONS FOR RELIEVING INTESTINAL CONGESTION

If either mother or child has a tendency toward intestinal congestion
(constipation), the mother should take wheat bran, thoroughly cooked,
with both the morning and the evening meal; or, a few drops of prune
juice, given to the child, will often relieve this condition, while
affording an excellent source of nourishment.

This menu is for the purpose of building tissue. It contains enough
carbohydrate matter to give a reasonable amount of fat and bodily
warmth, provided it can be assimilated. Eggs are an excellent proteid
food, when taken uncooked, whipped with a very little sugar. The number
may be increased as digestion improves.


WINTER MENU

_WEAK DIGESTION (ALMOST INVALID)_

On rising, drink a cup of hot water, and devote a few minutes to deep
breathing and such exercises as can be taken.

taken with both the morning and the evening meal.

The quantity of food should be governed by the condition of the patient
as to strength, and as to powers of digestion and assimilation.


SPRING MENU

_BUILDING UP THE NERVOUS SYSTEM INCREASING VITALITY_

On rising, drink two glasses of water, eat a little of some juicy
fruit, and devote as much time as possible to vigorous deep breathing
exercises before dressing. In taking these movements, inflate the lungs
to their fullest capacity, and hold the breath for half a minute while
executing one or two movements. In this way the cell capacity of the
lungs can, in many instances, be doubled. Large lung capacity is of
primary importance in cases of nervousness.

Choice of the following menus:


    MENU I                             MENU II


BREAKFAST

    Half a cup of boiled wheat,        Cherries or berries with

                                         equivalent quantity of
                                         raisins

    Two of the following vegetables:   Two of the following vegetables:

      corn-meal or wheat bran            small portion of fish
    Half a glass of buttermilk         A baked white potato--eat
                                         skins and all

About two glasses of water should be drunk at each of these meals--half
a glass at the beginning, a glass during the progress of the meal, and
half a glass at the close.

These meals are rather liberal, and if there should be the slightest
fullness experienced after eating, the quantity should be reduced. The
breakfasts are light, and one might add slightly to them if they do not
satisfy normal hunger.

Mastication should be perfect. Eating should be very deliberate. Avoid
heavy reading or earnest conversation while eating; these disturb the
flow of saliva and prevent thorough mastication.

A cup of wheat bran, well cooked, should be taken with the morning and
the evening meal about twice or three times a week.

A glass of water and the juice of a sweet orange may be taken just
before retiring, and exercises as prescribed.

    Corn or a baked potato
    Very tender fish, game, or chicken, if flesh food
      or something salty is desired

If the weather is extremely warm, all fat foods should be reduced to
the minimum, and an abundance of water drunk both at meals and between
meals.

At least an hour during the day should be devoted to moderate exercise
and deep breathing.

In all conditions of malassimilation, there is more or less
autointoxication. If the diet has been leveled or balanced, the next
most important thing is exercise. The best balanced menus will not be
effective in removing the causes of these conditions unless there is
sufficient time devoted to exercise to create natural hunger.


FALL MENU

_MALASSIMILATION AND AUTOINTOXICATION_


BREAKFAST

    A bunch of grapes (Thoroughly masticate the
      skins, swallowing the seeds and pulp whole)
    Two eggs or one glass of buttermilk

Every atom of solid food herein named should be masticated to infinite
fineness. Do not overeat; eat slowly and do not engage in animated
conversation while eating.

Every morning and every evening, immediately on rising and just before
retiring, devote from three to five minutes to vigorous deep breathing
exercises. If the bowels are constipated, take a tablespoonful of wheat
bran on rising; also a small bunch of grapes and a glass of water. Take
a spoonful or two of wheat bran, cooked, with the breakfast and evening
meals, and another spoonful in hot water just before retiring.

The quantity of bran taken should be governed by the severity of the
condition. When the bowels are once regulated, the quantity may be
modified, or perhaps omitted entirely.


WINTER MENU

_MALASSIMILATION AND AUTOINTOXICATION_

On rising, drink two cups of hot water. This should be followed by
vigorous exercise in a thoroughly ventilated room.


BREAKFAST

    The strained juice of a sweet orange (Florida

SPRING MENU

_NO APPETITE_

A very sharp distinction should be drawn between appetite and
hunger. Appetite is a cultivated desire expressed through a sense of
/Craving/. Hunger is the normal demand for food, expressed
through the salivary glands. Appetite is the desire for liquor, coffee,
tobacco, morphin, etc., and for food when one habitually overeats.
It is expressed by an empty feeling or craving in the stomach, while
hunger is felt only in the salivary glands, and in the region of the
throat and the mouth. Appetite weakens the body; hunger stimulates
thought and action.

Normal hunger can be produced by limiting the quantity of food below
the actual needs of the body, for three or four days, or perhaps a week.

When normal hunger returns, the quantity may be increased, but the
combinations should be observed for a week or two.

The following are limited menus composed of foods that will produce
hunger after the third or fourth day:

On rising, devote at least five minutes to vigorous deep breathing
exercise before an open window, or in the open air. Take a bit of juicy
fruit and a glass of water.


BREAKFAST

    Cherries or berries (very ripe); neither cream
      nor sugar
    A banana, very ripe, eaten with two egg whites,
      thoroughly whipped, and a very little thin cream


LUNCHEON

    A green salad
    One fresh vegetable; peas or asparagus preferred
    A new potato


DINNER

    A green salad, with nuts
    Two fresh vegetables
    A whipped egg or a cup of junket

It may be well to omit the noon meal for the first three or four days.

If there is the slightest tendency toward constipation, a tablespoonful
or two of wheat bran, cooked, should be taken at both the morning and
the evening meal.

A glass of water should be drunk just before retiring, and at least ten
minutes devoted to exercise and deep breathing.

As appetite returns, the quantity of food may be increased, and a few
heavier articles added, such as coarse cereal for breakfast, and a bit
of fish or an omelet for dinner.

A cup of water and a very ripe peach or plum followed by vigorous deep

The primary purpose of fat in the diet is to produce body-heat. About
three ounces of fat will maintain normal heat in the average-sized
body for a period of twenty-four hours. The amount of fat taken by
the athlete should be governed by exposure and temperature of the
atmosphere.

The best sources of fat are butter, nuts, and salad oil.

WINTER MENU

_FOR MENTAL WORKER TO INCREASE BRAIN EFFICIENCY_

Eggs, milk, and sugar are the most readily convertible nutrients
known to the science of food chemistry. In combination they represent
the highest form of the nitrogenous (proteids and the carbohydrate)
compounds, therefore to increase physical efficiency one should take as
much of these as possible.

If one is under weight, it would be advisable, especially during the
cold weather, to take three eggs for breakfast, four eggs with a quart
of milk for luncheon, and a vegetable dinner as laid out in Menu II.

Choice of the following menus:

strenuous.

BREAKFAST

    One or two extremely ripe bananas, eaten with
      nuts, cream, and raisins
    Fresh milk

    A green salad, with tomatoes and nuts

      (The vegetables to be cooked in a casserole
      dish)
    A potato--prepared choice
    One very ripe banana, with figs and either cream
      cheese or fresh cream


SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF SUNSTROKE

From one to two glasses of cool water should be drunk at each of these
meals.

Mastication of every atom should be complete.

Hurried eating is the most prolific cause of fermentation. Fermentation
is the cause of intestinal gas, sour stomach and indigestion, also
constipation and torpid liver.

Avoid stimulants such as tea, coffee, tobacco, beer, or liquors. These
things excite heart activity, which causes excessive body-heat.

Avoid sweets, especially sweet soda-fountain drinks. Sugar is composed
largely of carbon, and carbon is one of Nature's greatest heat-makers.

Confine the diet largely to semi-acid fruits, fresh vegetables, green
salads, milk, eggs, nuts, and a very limited quantity of bread and
cereal products.

Cereal starch is the most difficult of all carbohydrate matter to
digest.

Drink an abundance of pure water at meals and between meals.

Avoid all mixed-up, sweetened and charged water. There is nothing
better than plain spring or distilled water.

Do not eat too many things at the same meal. Three or four articles are
sufficient.

Avoid meat of all kinds, and eat a very limited quantity of fats.

By all means do not overeat. Every atom of food taken into the body
that is not used must be cast off at a tremendous expense of energy.
The casting-off process is what we call dis-ease.

Every housewife and mother should know enough about the chemistry of
food to avoid serving at the same meal things which are chemically
inharmonious.

If these simple laws were observed, sunstrokes and heat prostrations
would be almost unheard of.

Summer is the time when Nature is rebuilding and revitalizing all forms
of animal life; it is also the time when she is producing all of the
material with which to do this building in its best and purest form,
therefore summer should be the time when people are at their best. The
reason they are not is because they do not understand the simple laws
that govern human nutrition.

wheat bran, cooked, with the breakfast, and, just before retiring,
another half cup in hot water.

If possible, spend from two to three hours each day in the open air,
taking vigorous exercise. Oxygen is nature's great stimulant and
life-giver.

Eat slowly and masticate very thoroughly.

If there is a tendency toward obesity, sugar should be omitted from the
meals entirely.

Proteid foods should predominate in the diet. The following are the
most soluble and readily assimilable group of proteid foods suitable
for these menus, given in the order of richness and importance:
