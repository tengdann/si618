    Slightly imperfect.

    The first book printed in English in North America. The
    version of the Psalms was made about the year 1636, the
    principal divines of the country each translating a portion.
    The principal part of the work was committed to Mr. Richard
    Mather, minister of the church in Dorchester, who probably
    wrote the preface also, and to Mr. Thomas Weld and Mr. John
    Eliot, associate ministers of the church in Roxbury. The
    work of printing was completed in 1640, and the new Psalm
    book was adopted at once by nearly every congregation in the
    colony of Massachusetts Bay, and for that reason it came to
    be known as the Bay Psalm book. Of this famous book there
    are only ten copies known to be extant, of which only four
    are perfect.

    "The first number of 'The Echo' appeared in 'The
    American Mercury,' at Hartford, in August, 1791. It was
    written at Middletown, by Richard Alsop and Theodore Dwight.
    The authors, at the time of writing it, had no expectation
    of its being published. Their sole object was to amuse
    themselves and a few of their personal friends. The general
    account of its origin and design is given in the preface to
    the volume, in which the numbers were afterward collected
    and published in New York. With the exception of a few lines
    written by Drs. Mason F. Cogswell and Elihu H. Smith, and a
    part of one or two numbers by Dr. Lemuel Hopkins, the entire
    work was the production of Messrs. Alsop and Dwight. Judge
    Trumbull never wrote a line in it."--C. W. Everest, _Poets

    "The following extracts are from a poem entitled
    _Democracy_, the first canto of which was printed in
    New-York, in March, 1794, and at the time excited no
    inconsiderable share of the public attention. This poem
    was written in consequence of a tumultuous meeting of
    the citizens of that place, instigated by a few popular
    demagogues, for the purpose of prescribing to Congress the
    adoption of hostile measures against Great Britain. The
    second canto, which was of much greater length, was prepared
    for the press immediately after the appearance of the first,
    but the timidity of the booksellers, and the peculiar
    circumstances of the times prevented its publication."

    "A free parody of the _Lay of the last minstrel_....
    The production is principally devoted to satirizing the
    predatory warfare of the British on Chesapeake Bay, and,
    what is somewhat remarkable, was published in a very
    handsome style in London with a preface highly complimentary
    to the author. The hero is Admiral Cockburn, and the
    principal incident the burning and sacking of the little
    town of Havre de Grace on the coast of Maryland. It had at
    that time what might be called the distinction of provoking
    a fierce review from the London Quarterly. It is clever as
    a parody, and contains many passages entirely original and
    of no inconsiderable beauty."--Duyckinck, _Cyclopaedia of

    One of "Fifty copies reprinted from the edition of 1728."

    "The only known copy of this poem in America, so far
    as the writer has been able to ascertain, is in the Boston
    Public Library, where it was acquired a few years ago. The
    British Museum has also a copy. The author is unknown. It
    is quite inferior to the verses of Mather Byles on the same
    occasion, and its publication lacks the Governor's sanction,
    which was given to the former. Both poems are printed in
    similar type, and probably were from the same press. The
    rarity of this publication has induced the present reprint,
    which is approximately in fac-simile of the original.
