Professors Von Pettenkofer, Parkes, and Buck, pronounced Hygienists,
have contributed largely to establishing theories regarding clothing
materials and their relations to health. These conclusions have led to
a more general consideration thereof, in the therapeutics, as well as
prophylaxis in medical practice.

Wool is regarded as deserving first consideration.

[Illustration: MAGNIFIED--WOOL FIBRE.]

The fibres are cylindrical collections of numerous cells, and present
each the appearance of a tube covered with epidermic scales which
overlap each other. The zigzag markings are characteristic.

Cotton, for various reasons, may be regarded as next in importance,
providing consideration be given to the manner of application, in
combination with wool.

This is fully verified by Krieger's experiments.

[Illustration: MAGNIFIED--COTTON FIBRE.]

[Illustration: SECTION SAME--COTTON FIBRE.]

The fibres of cotton appear to be made up of flat, ribbon-shaped cells,
thicker at the edges than in the middle. They are irregularly twisted,
with a broad longitudinal cavity more or less well defined. There is
frequently a kind of net-work striation apparent on the surface.

With regard to the comparative value of these fibres in application
we refer here to the Tables of Mattieu Williams, page 31 of this
Treatise. It remains, therefore, to have a material of these fibres so
constructed that it will embody all scientific essentials. The first
satisfactory material of the "Jaros Hygienic Wear" was laid before
the Medical Profession in Chicago, November, 1884, and, guided by
their suggestions, the "Wool Fleece Fabric" was so materially improved
that, on January 4, 1886, L. L. McArthur, M.D., in a paper before the
Chicago Medical Society, states: "Now, gentlemen, this device was a
particularly 'happy one,' in that all the requirements of a truly
hygienic wear are provided--porosity, warmth, absorbent powers and
elasticity."

[Illustration: JAROS HYGIENIC MATERIAL--MAGNIFIED.]

It will be seen that the material is a fleecy wool surface knitted
into a cotton framework--resembling in many essential points a
natural sheep's pelt. A prominent factor regarded in the claim for a
reproduction of the natural pelt, is the preservation of the yolk
which, if left in the wool, preserves its pliancy. It forms a kind of
natural soap, consisting principally of potash salts with animal oil
almost entirely soluble in cold water. Special care must therefore be
taken in washing the wool, and this has been one of the latest results
added to the success of the "Jaros Hygienic Material." The features
warranting precaution in scouring wool, and advised by scientists,
are based on the following possibilities: Excess of alkali has to
be guarded against, since uncombined caustic acts energetically on
the wool fibre, and is indeed a solvent of it. On this account soap
solutions cannot be too carefully prepared to prevent making the wool
brittle.

"A material of loose texture confining much air in its interstices
is warmer than same amount of clothing material closely woven.
Wool or cotton carded and spread out in the shape of a wadding
and held, will make a warmer garment than the same quantity spun
and woven, and similarly covered. This applies with force to
underclothing."--"Ziemsen," Vol. XVIII.

PROPHYLAXIS.--In the consideration of a prophylactic measure this
Underwear accomplishes the desideratum for protection.


L. D. Rogers, A.M., M.D., in a paper, states:

A fabric, therefore, so constructed as to allow a layer of woolen
fibre to lie between the skin and a layer of cotton fibre, and
sufficiently open and loose as to contain the largest possible
amount of air is the ideal. _The Jaros Hygienic Underwear material,
a new fabric, seems beautifully adapted to this end. A layer of
woolen fibres, soft and fleecy, is firmly held on one side of and
in the meshes of an exceeding porous cotton fabric, so that while
one extremity of a fibre lies against the skin, the other is in
contact with the cotton; thus admitting of the rapid transference
of all dampness of perspiration to the cotton where it is retained,
and consequently leaving no moisture next to the skin to absorb and
diminish the heat of the body. The importance of this subject, and
the possibilities of this new fabric for the prevention of colds, and
their resultant diseases, can only be appreciated when we remember the
simple fact that it is impossible to take a cold so long as a healthy
condition of the skin, and an even temperature of the surface of the
body, are maintained_.




  REPORT OF C. B. HOLMES,

  President Chicago City Railway Company.


 ""The Jaros Hygienic Underwear" has been in use with Conductors
 and Gripmen of this Company since November, 1885, having been
 recommended by the Company's Surgeon, Dr. D. A. K. Steele. We speak
 for the men in asserting that this underwear is considered the best
 possible protection against cold and changeable temperatures, which
 are especially characteristic of this latitude, and its use has
 resulted in great protection of health and a corresponding increased
 efficiency. With conductors, whose occupation necessarily prevents
 the wearing of a very heavy overcoat, it is of great advantage, and
 gripmen and drivers are enabled to thoroughly protect themselves in
 their exposed positions without an overplus of clothing, otherwise
 necessary."

 These citations might be continued at great length, covering Reports
 of Police and Fire Departments in our large cities, and from many
 Railway Corporations and Physicians.

THERAPEUTICS.--In the Therapeutics of Medicine the Underwear is
regarded as specially indicated in Rheumatism, Kidney Disease
(Bright's), and Pulmonary Consumption.



  RHEUMATISM.

  J. NEVINS HYDE, A. M., M. D., gives expression as follows:

 "I have often employed the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" in cases of
 muscular and other forms of rheumatism, and always with advantage to
 the patient. I have had knowledge of these undergarments sufficiently
 long to justify me in stating very positively that I regard them as a
 valuable means of protecting the surface of the body from the climatic
 changes to which it is much exposed."



DAVID WARMAN, M. D.

 "One of my patients wearing the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" is a
 sufferer from muscular rheumatism, and since he donned the garments he
 has not had an attack, although the weather has just been of the kind
 to produce the disease."


  KIDNEY DISEASE.

  BRIGHT'S DISEASE AND ALLIED AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS.

By CHARLES W. PURDY, M.D., Prof. of Genito-Urinary and Renal Diseases
in the Chicago Polyclinic.

 Chapter 1--Albuminuria.--Pages 54-55.

 "THE SKIN.--* * * The most thorough protection to the skin is secured
 by the use of the JAROS HYGIENIC WEAR, especially during the cold and
 damp season. * * * It will be seen that the cotton fabric secures a
 comparatively static condition of air next the skin, while the fleece
 wool combines the minimum radiation of heat from the body with the
 greatest attainable hydroscopic power, thus securing uniform dryness
 and warmth of the skin under various conditions of atmosphere. Dr. L.
 L. McArthur has demonstrated before the Chicago Medical Society the
 superiority of the Jaros Wear over all other fabrics for the purpose of
 protecting the skin against rapid changes of temperature and humidity,
 and my own experience with it altogether bears out his deduction."



 DR. I. N. DANFORTH, in January, 1886, states:

 "I am much impressed with the value of the "Jaros Hygienic Wear,"
 especially in renal and other diseases in which sudden changes of body
 temperature are hazardous. I think it will prove a valuable addition
 to our means of treating chronic, renal and other diseases in which
 full protection of the skin is all important."


  PULMONARY CONSUMPTION.

J. W. PRICE, M. D.

ADDRESS BEFORE ELMIRA ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, JULY, 1887.

_Curability and Treatment of Pulmonary Consumption._

 "The dress of the consumptive patient should be adapted to equalize
 the temperature of the body, so loose that it interferes in no way
 with the natural functions. The underclothing should be woolen,
 either lamb's wool or flannel. After an extended observation of the
 benefits derived from wearing the "JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERCLOTHING,"--a
 wool fleece knit material of graded weights, adapted to the season,
 I believe it to be the best protective device yet known for these
 patients.

 "They are excellent non-conductors of changes of the temperature,
 and at the same time absorb cutaneous moisture--two most important
 qualities."

Added to these statements are many more in this Treatise.

[Illustration: WOMEN'S COMBINATION SUIT.]

Properly _fitting garments_ are advised, and as an illustration of the
results achieved, exact reproductions from life are given. The manner
and style adopted, is in keeping with all other features accomplished.
The matter of detail has been sufficiently thorough to embody also the
point of seaming.


_SEAM._

A special seam is used to overcome objections which caused discomfort
and irritation. This seam is flat, soft, and lends to the garments the
appearance of seamless wear, to which is added the perfect fit only
reached in cut and sewed underwear.

[Illustration: MEN'S SUIT.]


_CONCLUSION._

In the summary of the results of practice with the "Jaros Hygienic
Underwear" by U.S. Army Posts, U. S. Navy Pay Inspector's Department,
Police and Fire Departments, Railway Companies, etc., etc., all
scientific recommendations find verification.

Continuing the work of research and experiment, the aim is to aid the
Profession in gaining the results desired with an ideal in clothing
material.

CAUTION.--The success of the "Jaros Hygienic Wear," and the recognition
earned, has prescribed utmost care in properly stamping the Wear to
protect the Profession against possible misrepresentations.

 HYGIENIC CLOTHING.

 By L. L. McArthur, M. D.

 Treasurer Medico-Legal Society, Chicago: Attending Physician Michael
 Riess and Mercy Hospitals, Chicago.

 [Abstract of a paper read before the Chicago Medical Society on January
 4, 1886.]


The object of clothing should be the promotion and maintenance of good
health, together with a feeling of well-being under all atmospheric
conditions.

Consideration of the subject naturally sub-divides itself into:

    I. Materials.
   II. Texture.
  III. Form of clothing.

Chief among the materials used for clothing in the order of their
respective merits are linen, cotton, silk, and wool, the latter being
the best.

A few words as to these materials in the raw state:

Linen conducts heat better than cotton, silk or wool. It absorbs
moisture and does not shrink. Cotton, also a vegetable fibre, which is
hard, durable and does not shrink, has serious objections, in that it
is very non-absorbent of moisture. It does not conduct heat as well as
linen, but more rapidly than silk or wool.

Silk, an animal product, consisting of fine, smooth round fibrillæ,
having been in the liquid condition before leaving the body of the
silkworm, possesses no central canal, and no oily coating. It is
quite a good absorbent of moisture, ranking next to wool. At ordinary
temperature it always contains between 9 and 12 per centum of moisture.
In its sale or purchase, account is taken of the amount of moisture in
order to protect the purchaser from paying silk prices for water.

Wool, the fleece of sheep, an animal fibre, whose function in nature
has been two-fold, the protection from cold, and an aid to evaporation
of cutaneous moisture, is admirably fitted as a material for clothing.
It permits but slow radiation of heat, and absorbs moisture better than
any other clothing material. It does this, according to Parkes, in two
ways: 1st. By interposition between the fibres. 2d. By penetration into
the central canal. His experiments led him to believe its hydroscopic
powers double in proportion to its weight and quadruple for surface, as
compared with cotton or linen. Perfectly dried wool has the power of
absorbing 50 per centum, by weight, of water. Under ordinary conditions
it contains 12 to 18 per centum.

Other things being equal, then woolen fabrics will best prevent too
rapid radiation of heat; silk next, cotton third, linen fourth.

Wash-leather, buckskin and chamois-skin need not be considered, for
one or all of the following reasons: Expense, poor provision for
evaporation, poor washing qualities.

As absorbers of moisture, rank, respectively: wool, silk, linen and
cotton.

_The advantages of cotton over wool lie in its cheapness and
non-shrinking qualities. If properly constructed, however, the
advantageous properties of wool can be utilized without the shrinking
by using a cotton framework, into the meshes of which the loose, raw
fleece is worked._

That fabric will be best adapted for health, which combined with
greatest porosity, possesses the least (a) conductivity, (b) greatest
hydroscopic power, and (c) best shape.

By porosity is understood the freedom with which air can pass through
the interstices of a fabric. Pettenkoffer's practical demonstrations
with the following cloths, shows that if heavy flannel be taken as
permitting 100 parts of air to pass, linen permitted 60.3 or 60 per
centum; lambskin 50.7 or 50.7 per centum; silk fabric, heavy, 14.4 or
14.4 per centum; glove-leather 1.5 or 1.5 per centum.

The conclusion follows that porosity does not injure the powers of
preventing radiation (it even increases it) for flannel, admittedly the
warmest clothing, permits the freest circulation of air.

In consequence of the fact of a fabric's possessing great porosity,
it contains in its interstices what might be called "residual air."
Whether gases possess conductivity is open to discussion, but this is
certain, that such power is very small. Could we by any means envelop
the body in a layer of stationary air, we could reduce the heat-loss to
a minimum. A striking example of the poor conductivity of _stationary
air_ is related by Dr. Kane, the Arctic explorer, who found that
on perfectly still days they could withstand, without suffering, a
temperature of-70 F.,[A] with ears and hands exposed, but the moment a
breeze sprung up it became necessary to seek immediate shelter.

  [A] 70° F, below Zero.

Although impossible to perfectly accomplish this, (_i. e._, the
surrounding of body in a stationary envelope of air), that cloth or
fabric which most nearly approximates this, other things being equal,
will prove itself the warmest as well as best adapted for evaporation
of cutaneous moisture. Such a nearly stationary air occurs naturally
in the various pelts, and although in many the integument is visible
beneath, yet they can withstand the most rigorous weather. Thus
Krieger's experiments with tin cylinders containing hot water with two
coverings of different materials, between which an interval of 1/8
to 1/4 inch was left, proved (after subtracting the amount due for
conduction) the impediment to radiation by the second layer to be,
_viz_: linen, 32; silk, 32; flannel, 29.

Thus showing that the stationary air, rather than the material out of
which the second layer was made, was the main factor in preventing
radiation.

He then experimented with single and double layers of the same material
surrounding these cylinders, obtaining the following instructive
results; the numbers representing the proportionate loss of heat
through double to single layers, the losses through the single ones
being taken at 100:

  Double Stuff, ("Doppel Stoff") Fleece-lined cotton      69-76
  Buck-skin                                               74-86
  Flannel                                                    86
  Home-spun linen                                            91
  Stout, extra heavy silk                                    94

From these results the conclusion is obvious that the substance and its
weight are of less consequence, where _radiation_ is in question, than
its texture and volume. Believing that the explanation was due to the
"residual air," experiments have been made with loose wadding, noting
the rapidity of fall of temperature, on compressing the same wadding,
when the fall was far more rapid.

Again, the loss of heat through a rabbit's fur being taken as 100, when
shorn of its hair it rose to 190; and further destroying its porosity
by a coating of gum-arabic, it rose to 296. (Dict. Hygiene.)

By greatest porosity best provision is made for the evaporation of
perspiration, the quantity of which varies greatly under different
conditions. In a day of rest the amount as determined by Seguin and
Voit is 900 grams (about 1 quart). During exercise it may increase to
quantities incredible, were the figures not furnished by the best of
observers. For example: Dalton mentions its increase to 380 grams per
hour! and Dr. Southwood Smith has seen it rise to 1,600 grams per hour
during violent exercise in a heated atmosphere! Now, if a clothing
possesses no porosity, _e. g._, the mackintosh, and rubber clothing
generally, even without exercise, there would collect somewhere beneath
it a quart of water, but if exercise be indulged in, the quantity
may become large indeed; particularly after the atmosphere beneath
has been surcharged with vapor, and evaporation ceases to occur from
the surface, and with it the grateful cooling process. The French
Government has not permitted its introduction into its army for such
obvious reasons. Of course, for a short time during a shower they
may and do prove useful; but I am convinced that many have incurred
most serious injury, even death, by throwing off the rubber clothing
after the inner clothing had become permeated with moisture, when the
chilling, incident to the sudden increased evaporation, has resulted in
some acute inflammation.

Moreover, the evaporation of the normal cutaneous moisture (with that
of the lungs) requires 750 heat units or one-fifth of all the heat
produced in the system. (Dalton.) Conservation of part of this loss
contributes an equivalent amount of force to the organism, since heat
and force are interchangeable terms. _This can be done._

Under normal conditions evaporation of perspiration occurs in the
"insensible," _i. e._, vapor state, but change of these conditions
(increased heat, and moisture in the atmosphere, increased exercise,
etc.,) causes it to collect upon the integument in the visible or
sensible state, and unless conducted away, may chill the body.
Prevention of such condensation will avoid such dangerous and
deleterious influences. The cause of condensation is a lowering of
the temperature. _We have simply to maintain its temperature until at
a perceptible distance from the body. This can be accomplished by a
layer of loose wool, such as is hereafter described. The "residual air"
having been once raised to the body temperature, it remains so, and the
vapor does not assume the liquid state until meeting with the chilling
influences in the outer layer of cloth._

Finally, bodies passing from the gaseous to the liquid state emit the
heat--latent heat--which was essential to their assuming the gaseous
condition. This occurring in the case of perspiration in the cloth
interstices increases by just so much their warmth, in other words
lessens the demand for heat production.

Before leaving the subject of texture, note should be made of the
importance of its being of a loose nature. _However great the
hydroscopic power of a material in the raw state, if it be tightly
woven that power is greatly diminished, or even quite destroyed. Hence
the advantage of loosely knitted over tightly woven goods._

Important indeed is the proper fitting of clothing. However good the
materials they may then not accomplish their purpose for the following
reasons:

I. By close application to the skin certain materials acting as
cutaneous stimulants, maintaining an active equable circulation. Wool
possesses this property most markedly; even in some delicate skins
proving an irritant. A very marked increase of oily matter is excreted
over these areas where oil-glands exist in greatest abundance, _i. e._,
mesial line of thorax, in front and behind; thus improving the
flexibility of the skin.

II. By fitting neatly, chambers of air heated by the body are not
with every change of position of the wearer forced out, as occurs in
illy-fitting clothing. Upward currents of air naturally occur, and if
permitted to exist carry off large amounts of caloric. Simple attention
to these two facts reduced the death rate of the Wurtemburg Army Corps
from 3.22 to 1.64, as compared with the other departments of the German
Army.

The general application and advantages of such an ideal clothing to
diseased conditions, it is needless for me to describe to a body of
medical men; but particular references ought to be made to rheumatism
and nephritis, ("kidney troubles.") To the former, because best
provision is made for cutaneous elimination (always acid!) so essential
in that disorder, in which there is so marked a diminution in the
alkalinity of the blood; to the latter because sudden congestions are
obviated in an organ already overworked, by preventing sudden chilling
of the surface.

_It only remains for me to call your attention to my accidentally
finding such a clothing upon a patient of mine (Mr. Jaros), and the
tests to which I have put it._

_He described its history and manufacture as follows_:

"_While suffering from an attack of rheumatic sciatica in the Harz
mountains, following a peasant's advice, I enveloped myself in loose
lamb's fleece which he provided, and I experienced speedy relief. On
reaching Berlin I consulted Chief Councillor-of-Health, Dr. Abarbanell,
who advised me to have constructed some underwear with a fleece lining.
I sought a weaver and had some underwear knitted, into the meshes of
which were worked, "by hand," during the process of knitting, layers of
loose lamb's wool._"

Now, gentlemen, this device was a particularly happy one, in that all
the requirements of a truly hygienic wear are provided for.

_Porosity, warmth, absorbent powers and elasticity. With advice he
set to work and perfected a modification of the knitting machine
which incorporated into the meshes of the cloth loose lamb's wool.
The samples presented speak for themselves as to its success. By the
use of such a fabric, perspiration (unless excessive indeed) remains
in the insensible state until it meets with the cooling influences
externally in the cotton framework, the integument remaining dry, while
the cotton back, as well as the linen shirt over it, may be "wringing
wet." Exposure to cold draughts with such a suit does not chill the
integument because the sudden increased evaporation occurs at a
distance from the skin, and is separated from it by a layer of wool._

_To test the soundness of the theory I submitted myself to a
temperature of 115° F., under as nearly as possible the same
atmospheric conditions, with the three chief winter suitings, and
obtained the results in table below:_

_From these experiments it is to be seen, that of all the perspiration
exuded, the silk retained (by a small amount) the least; the hygienic
wear the next, and the English woolen goods the most. Note, however,
must be taken of two facts concerning the experiment with the silk
clothing._

_1st. The temperature was 2° F. lower than when testing the hygienic
wear, and 8° than the English goods. Hence less perspiration was thrown
out._

_2d. There was a difference of 15.5° of absolute dryness of the
atmosphere, hence evaporation took place more rapidly from the silk
goods in the dryer atmosphere. The barometer remained almost stationary
during the three days of observation._

_On emerging from the hot room into one of a temperature of 70° F.,
an immediate chilling was felt with the silk goods; while the English
gave a sensation of moisture and cold. The chilly sensation was not
experienced with the woolen-lined hygienic wear._


_CONCLUSIONS._

_1st. That fleece-lined goods are warmest._

_2d. Permit at least equal evaporation with the silk._

_3. Guard against sudden chilling of the body._

_4th. Are cheaper than silk and as cheap as Cartwright & Warner's._

_5th. Are particularly indicated in rheumatism and kidney disease._




PHILOSOPHY OF CLOTHING.

BY MATTIEU WILLIAMS.

 The following extracts are from the experiments and conclusions of
 Rumford, with supplements by Prof. Mattieu Williams, of England. (See
 "Knowledge," Nos. 171 to 205, "Philosophy of Clothing.")


The physiological confirmation of these results are not quoted;
confining the citations to the qualitative value of fibres, especially
sheep's wool, and the possibility of materials therefrom that possess
the _essentials_ recommended.

The first use of clothing being to keep the wearer warm, Rumford's
first inquiry was directed to find the best material for this purpose.
He saw at once that clothing did this by resisting the passage outwards
of the animal heat.

He accordingly constructed a model wearer, as described in the
following experiments: A mercurial thermometer, whose bulb was 55/100th
of an inch in diameter, and its tube about ten inches long. This was
suspended in the axis of a cylindrical glass tube about three-quarters
of an inch in diameter, ending with a globe 1-6/10 inch in diameter,
in such a manner that the center of the thermometer bulb occupied the
center of the globe, thus leaving a surrounding space to be occupied by
the material to be examined. The thermometer tube was graduated with
800 divisions between the freezing and boiling points of water--_i. e._,
a Reaumur scale divided to tenths of degrees. The thermometer was
held in its place by a long cork stopper.

He described his method of clothing the bulb as follows: The
thermometer being taken out of the cylindrical tube, about two-thirds
of the substance which as to be the subject of the experiment is
introduced into the globe; after which the bulb of the thermometer
introduced a few inches into the cylinder; and after it, the remainder
of the substance being placed round about the tube of the thermometer:
and lastly, the thermometer being introduced further into the tube, and
being brought into its proper place, that part of the substance which,
being introduced last, remains in the cylindrical tube above the bulb
of the thermometer, is pushed down into the globe, and placed equally
round the bulb of the thermometer by means of a brass wire, which is
passed through holes made for that purpose in the stopple closing the
end of the cylindrical tube.

The temperature he selected as the starting point was 70 degrees
Reaumur=190 degrees Fahr. He preferred this to the boiling point, as
he could obtain it accurately by first plunging the whole apparatus
duly charged into nearly boiling water, then allowing it to fall to 70
degrees, and immediately plunging it into a mixture of pounded ice and
water, where, by the aid of a little agitation, it remained steadily at
the freezing point.

The following table shows the results with the substances therein
mentioned, the quantity in each case being 16 grains:

The clothing value or "warmth" of these substances as thus applied
varies directly with these figures, representing the passage of heat or
their "non-conducting" power.

The experiments described were directed to the determination of the
relative power of different materials. (We have only quoted the
substances most generally used for clothing purposes.) These were
followed by another series upon certain given materials differently
arranged, or in different conditions of density. The same "passage
thermometer" was used. The question to be determined was, whether the
protecting power of the substances used in the previous experiments
was due to the non-conduction of the material of those substances
themselves, or whether the air imprisoned between their fibres was an
important factor. If the silk, wool and cotton did all the obstructive
work independently of the air, then the amount of obstruction should
vary with the quantity of fibre. As, in the experiments already
described, the fibres were loosely arranged round the bulk of the
thermometer, it was easy to increase their quantity by packing them
more closely, and yet retaining the other conditions of bulk, etc., the
same.

It was evident from the results, with 16 grains, 32 grains, 64
grains, that the protective power does not increase nearly in the
same proportion as the quantity of material when packed in the same
space. Had such been the case, and the rate of cooling proportionately
retarded, the experiment (with eider down from the duck) with 64 grains
should have been 1,304x4 5,216 seconds, instead of only 1,615 seconds.

The following displays the results obtained by using the same material,
in same quantity, but differently disposed, 16 grains of each:

From this it is to be seen that sheep's wool loose would retard the
passage of heat more perfectly than when spun into thread.

THE "JAROS HYGIENIC MATERIAL" _of sheep's wool unspun worn next the
body possesses the essentials for non-conduction of heat in a manner
described_.

It is an instance how an effort to apply pure science to practical
business may react in such manner that practical business shall become
a beneficent contributor to pure science.

Another practical question suggested is: Whether clothing materials
differ in their powers of absorbing the cutaneous exhalations; if
so, which are the most effective, and what are the relations of
this function to that of confining air, and thereby maintaining the
temperature of the body? If these two functions are opposed, then how
shall we effect a compromise? If, on the other hand, they go together
in any special material, the desirability of using this material is
doubly indicated.

_Sheep's wool_ does absorb (see Knowledge 191) the aqueous vapor.
Loosely distributed fibres of wool in a suitable fabric take hold of
the vapor of the insensible perspiration in the gaseous form, and by
virtue of gaseous diffusion continually exchange this with the gasses
of the outer atmosphere.

The conclusion, therefore, is that such a material is best suited for
clothing, both in winter and summer.

Sir John Billingall (lecturer on Military Surgery) mentions his
experience in India, and the proof of the utility of wool in checking
the progress of a most aggravated form of dysentery in the Second
Battalion of the Royals. The result of this has led to the enforcement
of the use of belts for tropical service. Mr. Sage of the Army Clothing
Depot at Pemlico, tells me many thousands have lately been made there.

My experience and subsequent observations have proven that, although
loosely woven flannels may advantageously prevent the sudden chills
from the evaporations of accumulated perspiration, this is better _done
by a knitted fleecy wool fabric worn next the skin_.

  HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR

  BY L. D. RODGERS, A. M., M. D.

  (From Peoples' Health Journal, October, 1885.)


Considerable scientific attention has recently been very profitably
devoted to the question of fabrics for underwear most conducive to
health. Interesting experiments have been made developing facts which
will surprise almost everyone on learning them for the first time. One
of the simplest and most readily understood of these experiments was
that of filling tin cans with hot water and wrapping each one with a
different fabric, and then observing with thermometers the varying
rapidity in the loss of heat. Thus showing accurately the relative
heat preserving value of each fabric. Of two cans surrounded with the
same amount of common cotton batting, in one case the cotton being
compressed, and the other not, the loss of heat was found to be much
more rapid in the former than in the latter. Showing, therefore,
conclusively, that loose open fabrics are warmer than those which
contain less air in their interstices. This accords with the well-known
fact that the new flannel is warmer than old which has undergone the
felting or fulling processes. Assuming that flannel contains 100 units
of air in its interstices, the permeability of other substances have
been found to be as follows: Linen, 58; silk, 40; buckskin, 58; kid,
1; chamois, 51. Doubling the layers of any given material does not
diminish the loss of heat in the same proportion. Assuming the loss
of heat through a single layer to be 100, through a double layer of
the same material it is found to be as follows: Thin silk, 97; gutta
percha, 96; shirtings, 95; stout silk, 94; thick home-spun linen,
91; chamois leather, 88-90; flannel, 86; summer buckskin, 88; winter
buckskin, 86. Thus we see that the loss of heat through two layers of
thin silk is only three per cent. less than through one layer. The
inference is that what the substance is and what its weight, does
not make so much difference as its texture and volume. How the body
may lose heat rapidly by wet clothing, and ill results follow, is
shown by the following experiment: A rabbit was shorn of its fur, its
temperature was then found to be 102 degrees. It was wrapped with a wet
cloth and placed in a room, the temperature of which was 66 degrees. At
the expiration of five hours the temperature of the rabbit was found
to be 76 degrees. The capacity of water to absorb heat is known to be
greater than any other substance. Now, when our clothing is damp from
perspiration or from any other cause, our bodies lose just as much heat
as the moisture in our clothing is capable of absorbing. The importance
of always having dry material next to the skin is evident, and that
material which will retain the least moisture is the best. Woolen
fibre is found to answer this purpose more nearly than any other.
In addition to its well-known filtering capacity, it has a greater
stimulating action upon the skin than any other. On the other hand,
cotton fibre, on account of its great capillary attraction, rapidly
absorbs and retains moisture. A fabric, therefore, so constructed
as to allow a layer of woolen fibre to lie between the skin and a
layer of cotton fibre, and sufficiently open and loose as to contain
the largest possible amount of air is the ideal. _The Jaros Hygienic
Underwear material, a new fabric, seems beautifully adapted to this
end. A layer of woolen fibres, soft and fleecy, is firmly held on one
side of and in the meshes of an exceeding porous cotton fabric, so that
while one extremity of a fibre lies against the skin, the other is
in contact with the cotton; thus admitting of the rapid transference
of all dampness of perspiration to the cotton where it is retained,
and consequently leaving no moisture next to the skin to absorb and
diminish the heat of the body. The importance of this subject, and
the possibilities of this new fabric for the prevention of colds, and
their resultant diseases, can only be appreciated when we remember the
simple fact that it is impossible to take a cold so long as a healthy
condition of the skin, and an even temperature of the surface of the
body, are maintained._

THE SKIN.--"* * * The most thorough protection to the skin is secured
by the use of the JAROS HYGIENIC WEAR, especially during the cold and
damp season. * * * It will be seen that the cotton fabric secures a
comparatively static condition of air next the skin, while the fleece
wool combines the minimum radiation of heat from the body with the
greatest attainable hygroscopic power, thus securing uniform dryness
and warmth of the skin under various conditions of atmosphere. Dr. L.
L. McArthur has demonstrated before the Chicago Medical Society the
superiority of the Jaros Wear over all other fabrics for the purpose of
protecting the skin against rapid changes of temperature and humidity,
and my own experience with it altogether bears out his deduction."

As a protection in extreme cold weather, this fabric is most
comfortably efficacious. It also reduces to a minimum the unpleasant
chilly sensations incident to a sudden change from an overheated room
to the untempered cold of out-door winter weather. It possesses,
therefore, hygienic value.

  _Curability and Treatment of Pulmonary Consumption._

  BY J. W. PRICE, M. D.

The dress of the consumptive patient should be adapted to equalize the
temperature of the body, so loose that it interferes in no way with the
natural functions. The underclothing should be woolen, either lamb's
wool or flannel. After an extended observation of the benefits derived
from wearing the "JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERCLOTHING,"--a wool fleece knit
material of graded weights, adapted to the season, I believe to be the
best protective devices yet known for these patients.

They are excellent non-conductors of changes of the temperature, and at
the same time absorb cutaneous moisture--two most important qualities.

JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR CO.:

I take great pleasure in recommending your HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR as the
best I have ever seen.

I have been wearing it now about four months, and can say it is the
best protection from colds, and being so thoroughly a non-conductor,
prevents the wearer from all ill effects of sudden changes of
temperature; also a Rheumatic Prophylactic.

A lady patient of mine, who has suffered some four years with chronic
bronchitis, is now wearing it, and is already very much relieved and
improving faster with it, and without medicine, than she has previously
with medicine, and at the same time wearing good flannel.

Dear Sir:--I have great pleasure in expressing my entire approval of
your underwear. It affords a better protection to the body in our
variable climate than any kind of flannel in use. Nothing but wool
is fit to maintain the capillary circulation of the skin, preserve
warmth and promote insensible perspiration, without which good health
impossible. I find your garments invaluable in the treatment of lung
complaints, and recommend them to all my patients.

expression to my high regard for your "Hygienic Underwear," and hope
you will accept the following as a spontaneous estimate of its value as
an adjunct to the treatment of certain diseases as well as a reliable
prophylactic. I have used your underwear in my family and recommended
it to my patients during the past year, and am firmly convinced that
its merits can not be overestimated as regards a comfortable and
protecting material for undergarments.

Persons affected with the rheumatic diathesis, those who have weak
heart or lungs, and those having catarrhal troubles, or who take cold
easily, should use your underwear constantly.

My Dear Sir:--The object of clothing is to preserve the proper heat of
the body, by protecting it both from cold and heat, and thus to prevent
the injurious actions of sudden changes of temperature upon the skin.
This object is most admirably accomplished by the "Jaros Hygienic
Wear." I have demonstrated this most important fact in my own person
during the past six months. For several years past I have been much
annoyed by occasional attacks of muscular Rheumatism. Since I began to
wear the "Jaros Hygienic Clothing" I have been almost entirely free
from these attacks. I deem them a valuable auxiliary in the treatment
of _Consumption, Bright's Disease and Rheumatism_.

by your company, as well as the observation of the use of it by
others have convinced me of its great value as an under clothing for
protecting the body against cold and various diseases in some measure
incident thereto, especially rheumatoid affections. The physical
principles of its construction appear to be correct, and it is
certainly very agreeable to the wearer.

DAVID WARMAN, M. D.      TRENTON, N. J., Feb. 11, 1888.

JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR CO., Chicago, Ill.

Dear Sirs:--My experience with your Hygienic Underwear, though somewhat
limited at present, I cheerfully give you. One of my patients wearing
it is delighted, and so am I. The patient was a sufferer from Muscular
Rheumatism, and since he donned your garments he has not had an attack;
although the weather has just been of the kind to produce the disease.
In this peculiar and ever changing climate of ours, it is important to
wear woolen undergarments the year round. They not only protect from
cold, but heat as well, by aiding in evaporation from the body and
keeping the surface warm.

The principles upon which your wear is constructed is undoubtedly
correct, in maintaining a healthy and normal action of the skin and
thereby diminishing the liability to taking cold. I take great pleasure
in recommending them to my patients.

  Sincerely yours,
  DAVID WARMAN.

WEAR I am fully satisfied of its merits in both protecting and properly
airifying the body, and especially do I recommend it as being well
calculated for persons predisposed to a rheumatic diathesis and a
general weakened condition of the nervous system, thereby greatly
preventing liability in contracting colds. I also recommend it as a
good general underwear because of its absorbing powers.

I have been wearing this winter the fleece-lined underwear of your
manufacture.

As a protection in extreme cold weather, especially for physicians in
the country who have often to get out of a warm bed and ride several
miles in the coldest weather, it has no equal. I have tried silk, as
also the best of ordinary flannels, but they fall far short of the
Jaros Underwear.

It has always been my misfortune. I was easily affected by cold, viz:
easy to take cold. Since wearing the Jaros Hygienic Underwear I have
not had a single cold.

For the underwear I claim as much a specific in rheumatism as quinine
in intermittent.

Since wearing your goods I have never had a single attack, while before
I have not passed a winter without experiencing several severe attacks
in the last twenty years.

  Respectfully yours,
  GEORGE K. FRANKS.

Gentlemen:--I cannot refrain from expressing to you the great
satisfaction and enjoyment I have received from the use of your Jaros
Hygienic Underwear during the past winter. I have been almost free from
rheumatic pains, from which I have heretofore suffered greatly, and
also enjoyed an exception from severe colds, which is a very unusual
luxury with me in the winter season; all of which I must attribute to
the protection afforded by my Hygienics. I am also gratified to find
that with the proper care in washing there is no perceptible shrinkage.
In short, in every way, I find them the most desirable article I have
ever seen for the object to be attained.

I shall be so loth to part with them that I hope you will manufacture a
lighter grade for summer wear.

You are at liberty to make any use you may see fit of my testimony.

Dear Sir:--I take pleasure in saying, that by the advice of my
physician, I obtained from you two suits of "Jaros Hygienic Wear." I
commenced wearing the same two weeks ago Saturday last. Up to that
time I had been a sufferer from a torturing rheumatic pain in my right
shoulder, which persisted in waking me about 4 o'clock every morning,
and which medicines seemed to relieve only temporarily. From the hour
that I commenced the use of your Underwear, I have never had the
slightest twinging of this pain. I feel under personal obligations to
you for the relief which I have experienced.

Dear Sir:--There has been a want in the truly hygienic features in
the undergarments so generally offered, which has in many cases added
obstacles in the treatment of certain diseases. I feel satisfied that
the "Jaros Hygienic Wear" possesses the great essentials in clothing,
maintaining an even temperature over the entire body and transmitting
moisture in the manner peculiarly claimed for your material. The effect
on such patients as I have prescribed it is satisfactory indeed, and
the experience on my own person in a case of Articular Rheumatism
of long standing, is truly marked. The condition of my body for the
last two winters, during which I have used the "Wear," was a feeling
of comfort and relief from pain, formerly caused by every change of
temperature. For Rheumatism and Catarrhal patients I am free to say
this is a valuable adjunct to our means of treating same.

  Yours very truly,

MR. J. JAROS.                 CHICAGO, Nov. 15, 1885.

Dear Sir:--The "Jaros Hygienic Wear" is unsurpassed in its purpose of
retaining an equable temperature and moisture of the surface of the
body, thus preventing an undue and sudden chilling, thereby inducing
catarrhs of the mucus membranes, conditions so common in this latitude.
Its economy and therapeutic value is apparent.

  Respectfully,
  MARY HARRIS THOMPSON, M. D.

MR. JAROS.              CHICAGO, Feb. 10, 1887.

Dear Sir:--I am sincere in expressing a favorable opinion of the "Jaros
Hygienic Wear" so far as my experience allows me to judge. The patients
to whom I have recommended it are of delicate health, very susceptible
to cold. They uniformly expressed themselves as pleased with the
garments made for them by you, and as having suffered far less from the
cold this winter than usual: a result which they attribute directly to
the power of the underclothing to prevent sudden chilling of the body
upon transition from a high to a low temperature. Personally, I have
worn the underclothing all winter, and believe my unwonted freedom from
attacks of bronchitis due to the efficient protection afforded by the
underwear. Your cloth seems to me to be a better non-conductor than
other woolen materials, and therefore particularly suitable to persons
with heart or lung disease.

  I am, very truly yours,
  ROBERT H. BABCOCK, M. D.

your underclothing, and certainly consider it the ideal wear for this

for which truly hygienic wear is sought, and therefore I cheerfully

Dear Sir:--With reference to the use of your "Hygienic Wear" I would
say that I am greatly pleased with it. All my patients have been
benefited from its use, and are delighted, some saying they would not
part therewith for double the cost. In debilitated _Nervous Troubles_,
_Kidney_, and especially _Lung Complaints_, it is a therapeutic agent,
almost indispensable in this and all northern climates.

your underwear on my own person. I found your "Wear" comfortably

Gentlemen:--The goods purchased of you have given perfect satisfaction,
and I have not failed to recommend the underwear to my patients and
friends.

The climate here is such that makes your goods almost a necessity, and
when properly introduced, I think no invalid will consider himself well

CLARA BLISS HINDS, M. D., 607 Thirteenth street, N. W.

  WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 1888.

My Dear Sir:--My attention was called to your Hygienic Underwear
during the session of the International Medical Congress in our city
last September. Being then in search of underwear, which combined
the requisite of warmth, lightness and durability, I determined to
try yours, hoping to find an article which I could with confidence
recommend.

I take pleasure in saying that after wearing the garments four months I
find them all I had hoped, and even more.

I have recommended them in several cases of uterine trouble, as well as
for delicate children, and without an exception the patient improved,
which, as other conditions were equal, I know was due to the underwear.

Maintaining an even warmth over the entire surface of the body the
circulation is improved, the various organs respond, and a general
improvement in the patient is the result.

I unhesitatingly recommend the Underwear, and earnestly hope that many
physicians may try it in chronic uterine troubles, and in the wasting
diseases of childhood, as I feel great good to suffering humanity will
come through this agency.

  Respectfully,
  CLARA BLISS HINDS.

Dear Sir:--The Underwear that I purchased of you has proved entirely
satisfactory. I find it just the thing in this climate where sudden
changes in the temperature are almost a daily occurrence.

I seldom wear an overcoat except when riding. Indoors I only wear a
light summer coat. The Underwear keeps one warm.

  EAST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 26, 1888.

MR. JAROS.

Dear Sir:--After wearing the _Jaros Hygienic Wear_ thus far during the
winter, I take pleasure in speaking of its merits.

I consider it _the best_ kind of underwear ever made. Never having been
able to wear any kind of woolen underwear before on account of the
irritation it produced, I was made glad when I found that the _Jaros
Hygienic Wear_ did nothing of the kind. The principles of the goods is
one of the best.

I experience no chilly feeling now when going from a heated room and
into the cold wind, as I always did with any other underwear.

The fitting of the garment is another great feature, it being the same
after repeated washing, so unlike any other woolen garments.

  Respectfully yours,
  CASPER BARSTOW.

My physician--Dr. W. H. Denslow Lewis, of Hyde Park--prescribed your
underwear, which I have worn ever since, both summer and winter.

They afford me great comfort, and have thus far warded off all

Dear Sir:--I am enabled by personal experience to testify to the
comfort derived from the use of your Wear during the cold weather,
and that the anticipated objection occurring to me before trial,
namely, that the unmixed wool in contact with the skin might prove
uncomfortable, has not appeared. In softness and warmth I have never
worn any fabric that equals it, while my original impression at first
sight in regard to the scientific construction of the principals upon
which it is based, has been strengthened by experience.

Dear Sir:--From personal experience I find your Underwear the most
comfortable and the best safeguard from taking cold of anything of the

I have no hesitancy whatever in heartily seconding it for Railroad

recommend your wear. It fulfills the demands of Hygiene and of comfort.
I have found it of great service as a therapeutic agent in cases in
which there is want of nervous or vascular tone--prevalent complaints
in this climate. Also in chronic diseases and general enfeeblement
when it is essential that the peculiar susceptabilities to changeable
climatic conditions should be guarded against.

TO MR. I. JAROS, Chicago, Ill.

Your underwear has been prescribed by me in a number of cases in which
I considered proper protection important. In rheumatic cases I have
found it of special benefit, as also in pulmonary and kidney affections.

My decided conviction is that its use will prove materially
advantageous in connection with other treatment in such cases. The
body is thereby protected from sudden chilling under climatic changes,
and that is most important. I shall take pleasure in continuing to
prescribe your "Hygienic Underwear," and hope your further endeavors
will meet with the success it deserves.

DEAR MR. JAROS.

I have commended your Hygienic Wear because I regard it as the best in
the market.

It is specially useful for asthmatics, and for those who suffer from
bronchial catarrh, because it protects from sudden and often disastrous
changes of atmospheric temperature. And then it is so unirritating and
comfortable and delightful to the wearer.

whom I ordered suits are well pleased, and say they will not dispense
with same, and signify their intention of ordering again when they

with the most satisfactory results. The durability of these goods is

in my recommendations while these are on the market.

Dear Sirs:--While I do not believe in the practice of recommending
to others everything or anything you like yourself, I must make an
exception to the rule in the case of your Hygienic Underwear. For years
I have had difficulty in finding the right quality of underwear for
myself, always trying my best to secure the best in the market, but
oftener disappointed than pleased. The goods of your manufacture please
me in every respect, and all to whom I have recommended them speak in
the highest terms of them. There is no doubt in my mind but that many
of our winter diseases and ailments could be avoided, and others easier
cured, by the use of these undergarments. You have my best wishes for
success.

  Truly yours,
  J. W. FLICK, M.D.

Gentlemen:--Permit me to add a word to the many which you have
undoubtedly already received in favor of the Jaros Hygienic Underwear.
I have worn them for two winters and one summer and am happy to express
myself as perfectly satisfied with them, for I find they more fully
meet my requirements than any other underwear now upon the market.
It is enough for me to say that my experience with them has proven
conclusively to me that they possess all the properties ascribed to
them by the makers.

  Yours very truly,
  E. L. R. THOMSON.

JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR CO., Chicago.

Gentlemen:--I am not in the habit of giving testimonials, and as a
rule am opposed to any thing of the kind, but after suffering from
rheumatism and kindred diseases for several winters, I was persuaded by
a friend to try Hygienic Underwear, and I am compelled to say that from
the time I began using them last November until spring I did not have a
touch nor a single chill during the entire winter, and I am confident
that it was attributable to the use of your Underwear, and I have not
hesitated to recommend them at every opportunity.

  Yours truly,
  J. F. MERRY,
  Gen'l Western Passenger Agent.



In a letter to a friend, Mr. Merry wrote at the time of receiving the
Underwear as follows.

  MANCHESTER, IA., Dec. 1, 1886.

Going home yesterday to dinner, I found awaiting me a suit of
underwear, and I was not very long in putting myself inside of them,
but with no idea that I could wear them, having tried almost everything
that contained wool, but never having found a garment I could wear next
to my skin containing a particle of wool. I have worn the suit for
two days without an unpleasant sensation; on the contrary, they are
delightful, and just what I needed.

Please have the following order filled for me.

  Yours truly,
  J. F. MERRY.



GEO. P. CARPENTER, M.D.

  CEDAR RAPIDS, IA., May 20, 1890.

I have examined the Jaros Hygienic Underwear, and consider it the most
perfect protection from severe cold and changes in temperature that I
ever saw. Especially will this underwear be useful for those afflicted
with rheumatism, lung troubles, or a dry condition of the skin. If the
actual use of these goods substantiates the theory I have formed, they
will be a valuable aid in the treatment of diseases, as well as to the
comfort of the wearers.

  Respectfully,

  REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON EXHIBITS.


_To the President and Members of the National Association Fire
Engineers._

GENTLEMEN:

The undersigned Committee on Exhibits begs leave to submit the
following as their report:

THE JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR FOR FIREMEN.

Underwear is a prime factor in acting as a guard against influences
from without, and if of a properly constructed material, must tend much
toward raising the efficiency of men in service, and thereby increase
the standard of an already progressive department. The material--the
Jaros Hygienic Wear--is a combination of unspun wool knitted into the
meshes of a spun cotton fiber. This is after the recommendation of
most eminent medical scientists in America and Europe. The wool unspun,
worn next the body, acts as a cutaneous stimulant (guarding against
irritation so often apparent with spun fiber), the body temperature
being stored between the individual fibers, prevents the cold from
directly striking the body from without (acting like double casement
windows in a house), and, therefore so valuable when men are forced
to sudden changes from in-doors to the cold of out-doors. The wool,
again, absorbs moisture from the body, and transports it readily to the
outer framework of cotton, thereby protecting against the possibility
of wet clothing next the skin to chill the surface at every change
in temperature. The cotton framework without, makes the material
two-fold in its action; for while the wool has a power of absorption
of moisture, the cotton has that of attraction and retention, so that
any perspiration exuded from the body is taken up by the cotton from
the wool and retained, while any water from without striking the cotton
surface is attracted and retained, and prevented from penetrating
through to the body. With all this, the material is porous, and does
not therefore, retard the poisonous exhalations from passing off.
The material is as nearly non-shrinkable as can be claimed of any
material, owing to the cotton back, thereby having an underwear which
will fit properly at first as well as last. No laps or folds to allow
air to circulate next the body are apparent, where the consideration
of shrinkage is discarded (which is the case with wear of spun wool,
whether knitted or woven.) The wear is also more durable. The cost
within the line of good woolen underwear. With a due consideration of
all the scientific as well as practical facts and experiences, the
Surgeon General of the United States Army recommended the wear to the
Quartermaster-General, War Department, U. S. Army, and the result of
experience by men and officers has given this underwear prominent place
under the equipments of the Northwestern posts. They also point with
great pride and satisfaction to the service among Police and Firemen
in such cities where practical application has been made. They feel
assured that the consideration of this subject, though comparatively
new with the chief officers of our departments, will gain a hearing,
with the view of raising the condition of the men.

Your Committee, upon examination, would recommend it for your
consideration.

J. JAROS, Esq.:

Sir:--Having become interested in the results from wearing your
underwear by myself and my men, I am pleased to state their own
experience, which is satisfactory in _every particular_, as to
protection against the cold and changeable temperature; raising the
general condition of the body, and maintaining an even temperature
under all the trying conditions; does _raise their efficiency_.
Personally, I can corroborate the good effect from wear, through the
most trying conditions.

  Very respectfully,
  JOHN REDELL.

JOHN W. REGAN, Ass't Chief.

  Boston Fire Department,       }
  BOSTON, May 23, 1889.}

JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR CO., Chicago, Ill.

MR. JAROS--Dear Sir:--There has been so great a progress in the
excellence of service in our Fire Department that it is safe to say we
are now at a time when it is necessary to consider matters that will
preserve the good condition of our working forces (the firemen).

The work you are doing in this direction deserves encouragement with
Fire Departments; for a recount of the value of proper underwear comes
strikingly before us after the use of the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear."
The experience of our men has been very satisfactory indeed in every
manner, protecting against the dangerous influences of the extremes
that a fireman must suffer in winter. My first impulse was to consider
the claims you made as exaggerated, but a few facts which are my
experience will illustrate to you how fully this underwear meets the
ideals for protection.

I have been a sufferer of rheumatism for many years, contracted in
service. Since I have worn your underwear it has not troubled me at
all, though I have been subjected to trying service the last winter.

On Saturday evening, the 6th of October, 1888, I put on your underwear.
It was cold and wet, typical New England weather. We had a fire in
a six-story building on the water front lasting four hours. I came
out of it with the water coming out of the tops of my rubber boots,
_completely wetted through_, so that I had to undress in the yard of my
dwelling when I got home. No ill effects were the result of that; when
otherwise I would have cough, cold, and surely rheumatic attacks.

About November 15th we had a very bad fire and had to fight it three
flights before we got to the top, the sixth story. Usually I get wet at
a fire. In this I did not, but instead I became thoroughly overheated
from wearing a very heavy pilot cloth coat and the result was, that I
got _sweated through_ and _through_. I did not get home until 3 o'clock
in the morning (nearly six hours), but _I felt splendid_. With other
underwear, best woolen, I always experienced a cold wet sensation under
similar circumstances, down my back, and generally miserable until I
could make a change.

This I consider the most important test for firemen and I feel more
than ever that the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" fills a long felt want in
Fire Departments. I cheerfully say: I would not be without it and many
of our men join me in this and say money cannot buy it from us.

Wishing you further success in the introduction of a truly meritorious
article and one based on scientific principles, I am

  Yours truly,
  JOHN W. REGAN, Ass't Chief.



  NEW HAVEN, CONN., FIRE DEPARTMENT.

  Headquarters New Haven Fire Department,}
   Office, No. 15 City Hall.}

Gentlemen:--The "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" furnished by your firm to a
large number of the members of the New Haven Fire Department for winter
wear has given very general satisfaction. Many of the men who have
practically tried them, express themselves highly pleased and state
that they would not wear anything else as a substitute if the cost was
much higher than what they paid for them.

They are no doubt of great value as a protection against the sudden
changes in our climate and proof against taking cold.

MR. I. JAROS, New York.

Dear Sir:--A thorough examination of the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear"
has proven to me the correctness of the scientific theories upon which
it is based. In view of the necessity of a most thorough protection
for firemen to guard against the influences of weather and service, I
have taken particular interest in going into the details of what this
Underwear will accomplish. The reports from other departments place
this Underwear as an important requirement of their clothing, and my
impression is that the benefits to men in service in this department
will be marked. From the mention made by Chief Dickinson on the value
of this Wear my opinion is fully borne out.

My Dear Sir:--In reply to your inquiry relative to the benefits derived
by our men from the use of your Wear, I beg to state that I have yet to
learn of a single case of illness due to exposure of any man who has
worn these garments. They were introduced into this Department about
three years ago, and quite generally adopted by our men. As I have
said, our records do not show that a man was obliged to go off duty
during any cold months of the year on account of sickness. I know of
several who did not get the Wear who were ill, and purchased it later
on account of the good words said of it by their comrades. The Wear is
very popular in this Department, and from what our men tell me, they
prefer it to any other.

  Very truly yours,
  JAMES E. TRYON, Secretary.

Departments, as this underwear is considered by us as the best possible
protection against cold and changeable temperatures, which are
especially characteristic of this latitude, and its use has resulted in
great protection of health and a corresponding increased efficiency,
and I find them the most desirable article I have ever seen for the
object to be attained.

Dear Sir:--With regard to the "Jaros Hygienic Wear," extra heavy
fleece, I can say they have given eminent satisfaction among the
number of members of the Omaha Fire Department, who have found it
very comfortable in the biting blasts of winter, while fighting fire
in exposed streets. These impenetrable undergarments are just the
necessity for men whose calling keep them out doors in winter and at
nights, and they will certainly meet with approval by all who try them
in rigorous weather, as they were unanimously commended by my brave
fellows in this metropolis of the Upper Missouri.

  Yours respectfully,

  POLICE DEPARTMENT REPORTS.

  CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT.

INSPECTOR OF POLICE, City of Chicago,
  CHICAGO, January, 1889.

On the recommendation of Dr. Henrotin, Surgeon of Police and Fire
Departments, to Chief and Inspector of the Chicago Police Department,
the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" was brought to the notice of the members
of the force, and has been used for a number of years with greatest
satisfaction. The consideration of personal Hygiene to raise the
efficiency of policemen, is gaining more general attention by Heads of
Departments, and my personal observation as Inspector of this force is
corroborative of, the necessity of regarding the question of clothing
for officers; especially during the inclement and cold seasons, from
October 1st to April 1st, when disabilities arise from exposure, which
result in pulmonary and kidney troubles and rheumatic affections.

The "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" has proven a most efficient
guard, raising the condition of the men, and bearing out fully
the recommendations of Dr. Henrotin. My personal experience is
corroborative of this. Proper underwear makes an overplus of outer
clothing, which is debilitating for men in service, unnecessary. I take
pleasure in giving my opinion, and the result of experience with our
men, and do not doubt that the underwear, when applied, will assert its
worth in all the claims that are made for it.

comfort derived from the use of your Wear during the cold weather,
and that the anticipated objection occurring to me before trial,
namely, that the unmixed wool in contact with the skin might prove
uncomfortable, has not appeared. In softness and warmth I have never
worn any fabric that equals it, while my original impression at first
sight in regard to the scientific construction of the principals upon
which it is based, has been strengthened by experience.

DR. E. S. KELLEY, Surgeon of Police.

On a recount of the benefits derived by the policemen of our Department
last winter, I have found a full confirmation of the claims made for
the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear." The peculiarly cold and persistent
changes of temperature made the last season trying for the physical
condition of our officers; added to this a class of winter cholera
prevailed here, which was very debilitating. The observations have been
that all the men who wore the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" were free from
these attacks, and maintained a normal condition throughout.

Sirs:--Your heavy wear I have named "Blizzard" Underwear, after
wearing a suit myself, with the mercury 27 degrees below zero, with a
twenty-mile wind, I was perfectly comfortable, and felt a warm glow
of the skin during the whole trip. My ambulance driver reports his
experience with the thermometer 35 degrees below zero, and in a heavy
gale, saying the drawers were much warmer than two pairs of very heavy
woolen drawers he had been wearing, and that he did not feel the cold
in the slightest degree. We found it washed as well as any woolen
goods, and did not shrink. I am fully convinced of the excellent

heavy underwear can in no way be surpassed. I have been out in the
hardest blizzards known in this country, with the wind at 29 miles,
and the mercury at 46 and 47 degrees below zero, but found myself
comfortable; felt a warm glow of the skin at all times, and I find it
washes as well as any ordinary woolen wear, and does not shrink. I am
fully convinced of the excellent qualities of your goods, and find that
a great many of my friends and others are _very_ anxious for winter to
come again so that they may order. As I find it a protection against
all diseases during the cold and damp seasons, having proven this last

Hygienic Underwear during the past winter. I have been almost free from
rheumatic pains, from which I have heretofore suffered greatly, and
also enjoyed an exception from severe colds, which is a very unusual
luxury with me in the winter season; all of which I must attribute to
the protection afforded by my Hygienics. I am also gratified to find
that with the proper care in washing there is no perceptible shrinkage.
In short, in every way, I find them the most desirable article I have
ever seen for the object to be attained.

I shall be so loth to part with them that I hope you will manufacture a

  C. B. HOLMES, Pres't and Supt.,

  CHICAGO, March 2, 1889.

Gentlemen:--The "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" has been in use with
Conductors and Gripmen of this Company since November 1885, having been
recommended by the Company's Surgeon, Dr. D. A. K. Steele. We speak
for the men in asserting that this underwear is considered the best
possible protection against cold and changeable temperatures, which are
especially characteristic of this latitude, and its use has resulted in
great protection of health and a corresponding increased efficiency.
With conductors, whose occupation necessarily prevents the wearing of a
very heavy overcoat, it is of great advantage, and gripmen and drivers
are enabled to thoroughly protect themselves in their exposed positions
without an overplus of clothing, otherwise necessary.

The proper protection of men serving in Street Railway Companies is
of the greatest importance; since an efficient service in trying
weather is largely dependent on their prompt response. We have been
pleased to secure for our employees a contract figure on the "Jaros
Hygienic Underwear," and feel that the benefits fully justify us in our
continuance of this arrangement.

  Respectively yours,
  C. B. HOLMES, Supt.

My Dear Sir:--I have critically examined and practically tested the
"Jaros Hygienic Wear," and consider it the best fabric with which I am
acquainted, for retaining the animal heat, and preventing chilling of
the body by sudden changes of temperature. I consider the heavy wear
especially valuable for car drivers, firemen, policemen, or those whose
occupation expose them constantly to the inclemency of the weather.

Through my suggestion to the officials of the Cable Railway Company,
many of the Grip Drivers and Conductors are already using this wear
with the greatest satisfaction, lessening their risk of "taking cold,"
and bettering their HEALTH and EFFICIENCY.

who are wearing the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear," satisfies us that the
arrangements made for last season's delivery of the wear have been
appreciated.

The excellent protection under every change of temperature during the
winter months, guards against attacks so frequent with men exposed,
of rheumatism, kidney disease, and pulmonary troubles, and all
character of ailments resulting from colds. This is too often cause
for irregularities with men, which is a loss to them and often an
inconvenience to the Company.

We believe the underwear good, and just the thing for the purposes it
is advocated.

DR. I. JAROS.

I have very carefully examined and tested the "Jaros Hygienic Wear,"
and I find it the best hygienic wear manufactured. It is so constructed
as to conduct the moisture away from the body, thus retaining even
temperature, and preventing chilling of the surface by sudden changes.

The heavy will be especially adapted to switchmen and other railway
employees who are greatly exposed to the weather where cumbersome
overclothing is not only undesirable, but positively dangerous, as such
heavy outside garments impede their movements, and thus place them in
danger of accidents.

I especially recommend this wear to railway employees as a means of
comfort, safety and health.

would hold out in the claims you made.

I have bought the best woolen and heaviest silk underwear in prominent
cities where I have travelled, abroad as well as in this country, with
the special view of getting something that would protect me while in my
rubber dress, on the long, cold and damp voyages I make. The exercise
and heavy rubber suit which I wear often cause active perspiration,
and my observation has been that from one to one and a half pounds of
moisture is thrown off during an exhibition lasting from one and a half
to two hours. With all other kind of underwear, this moisture was taken
up only partially, the garments becoming thoroughly wet, and causing a
chilling which was always hard for me to overcome; in fact, after these
aquatic exhibitions, I found it absolutely necessary to be well rubbed
to draw the blood to the surface and produce reaction, to prevent
trouble.

I speak of other underwear to give you an idea of this action, and the
difference in the body under trying conditions.

Your wool I found admirably selected and prepared, and so incorporated
to act quickly and absorb the moisture thrown off.

My experience is that the "_Jaros Hygienic Underwear_" does not only
relieve the body of perspiration, but also carries it to the cotton
framework outside, which thoroughly retains it, thereby keeping the
wool inside perfectly dry.

Since I began to use the underwear, I have never felt the chilling
which had always affected me with other underclothing, and I do not
find rubbing after an exhibition necessary.

I have no trace of rheumatic pain, and I feel physically much better.
The difference in the amount of perspiration seems to me marked, which
I attribute to the fact that the body temperature remains more nearly
the same. I am so well pleased with your underwear, that I use it for
general wear as well, and find every point you have claimed to be
realized in its use. In conclusion, I can say, that your underwear is a
boon and blessing to men exposed as sailors, firemen, soldiers, and as
well as the general public. Wishing you the success you deserve,

  I remain, yours very respectfully,
  PAUL BOYTON.
