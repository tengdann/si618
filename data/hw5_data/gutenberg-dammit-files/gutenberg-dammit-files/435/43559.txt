OF THE
Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea,
_For the Year ended March_ 25_th_, 1861.


          MEMBERS OF THE BOARD, AND ESTABLISHMENT ARRANGEMENTS.

Descriptions, with plans, of the several wards, with the names and
addresses of the members of the vestry representing them, of the auditors
of the accounts, and of the officers, as required by the Act to be given
in each report, will be found in the Appendix No. 1 (pages 28 to 36).

At Easter, 1860, the usual election of churchwardens, sidesmen, church
trustees, and auditors of the church trustees’ accounts took place; their
names and addresses, together with those of the persons previously
nominated as fit to serve the office of overseers of the poor, and
submitted for the choice of the magistrates in special sessions, will be
found in the Appendix No. 3, (page 37).

The vestry on Easter Tuesday also elected John Moore Segar, son of John
Moore Segar deceased, for admission into the parochial charity school,
pursuant to the will of the late John Chamberlayne, Esquire.

The return usually ordered by the board previous to the annual election,
showing the attendances of each member, is reprinted in the Appendix No.
2 (and faces page 36); but as the period embraced in that return does not
entirely correspond with the parochial year, the tabular arrangement
commenced in the last report is continued:—

 From March      Vestry      Committee      Evening       Average
  25th to      Meetings.     Meetings.    Committees.   Attendances
March 25th.                                                  At
                                                         Vestries.
1856–7                  50            52           nil            23
1857–8                  53            59            31            23
1858–9                  45            85            37            27
1859–60                 45            92            32            25
1860–1                  44           109            74            28

A list of the members who have served upon the various committees, and
sub-committees, during the year, is given in the Appendix No. 4 (pages 38
to 41); and the list annually issued by the vestry clerk, containing the
names and places of abode of the parochial clergy and lay officers,
immediately follows it.  Appendix No. 5 (pages 42 to 46).

In November, 1860, in consequence of the numerous additional matters
connected with the new building, into which the vestry had now removed,
requiring the hall-keeper’s attention, the clerk reported that the
messenger’s duties were not satisfactorily performed, and the subject
being referred to one of the standing committees for consideration, a
youth was appointed upon their recommendation at ten shillings per week
to commence with.

During this year the vestry have contemplated some alterations in the
salaries of the officers, and upon the application of Mr. J. E. Salway,
one of the office clerks, for increased remuneration, in December, 1860,
referred the whole question of their duties and salaries to the committee
of works and for general purposes for consideration.  That committee for
the purpose of comparison, and in order to have some data before them
upon which to form a satisfactory opinion, requested Mr. Tite, M.P., to
move the House of Commons for a return from each vestry and district
board in the metropolis, of its population; number of houses; extent of
its area; aggregate length of its streets; and the value of property, as
assessed to live county rate, and the poor rate.  The committee wished
this return also to show the number of meetings held during the year,
whether of the full board or of committees, or sub-committees; as well as
the names and salaries of the officers, with particulars of any other
benefits enjoyed by them: and that this information might be tabularly
arranged in the order of the amount of population of each place.  See
Appendix No. 6 (page 47).

Mr. Tite however replied that Sir John Shelley had moved for such a
return, referring to one similar to that printed at page 69 in the second
report, but as the return moved for by Sir John Shelley differed from
that suggested by the committee, in several important particulars, the
vestry requested Mr. Tite to obtain the introduction into it of the
additional information.

The act for regulating the supply of gas to the metropolis rendered it
necessary that the vestry should consider the appointment of a Gas
Examiner; and having themselves determined to put in operation in this
parish the act for preventing the adulteration of articles of food and
drink by appointing an Analyst; a committee was appointed in March, 1861,
to confer with Dr. Barclay as to his acceptance of the latter office, and
the terms upon which he would undertake its duties, having regard to his
diminished duties as medical officer of health.  This Committee was
amalgamated with one appointed subsequently, and specially, to consider
the duties and salary of the medical officer of health, to whom was
referred also, the question of the appointment of the gas examiner.

In consequence of the heavy amount of the solicitors’ (Messrs. Lee and
Pemberton) bill for the year 1859–60, which included the greater part of
the law charges in the actions brought against the vestry by the London
Gas Light Company and Mr. Hornsby, the contractor, those gentlemen
suggested in the following letter to the vestry clerk that they should be
taxed:—

                                   44, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, W.C., London,
                                                           18th May, 1860.

    Dear Sir, We have given the subject of our Mr. Pemberton’s
    conversation with you respecting our bill of costs, mature
    consideration, and feeling the delicate position in which the vestry
    are placed as trustees accountable to their constituents, we would
    suggest that for the future all our bills be referred to Mr. Richard
    Dax, of the Temple, barrister at law, for taxation, and to certify
    the amount properly payable to us.  This course is adopted by the
    Great Western and North Western railway companies, the Oxford,
    Worcester and Wolverhampton railway company, the Shrewsbury railway
    company, the Metropolitan railway company now in course of formation,
    all of whom refer their solicitors’ bills to Mr. Dax for the
    satisfaction of the shareholders, and we believe it to be the
    practice with nearly all railway and other large companies; should
    the vestry resolve to do so, we shall feel great pleasure in
    submitting our bills to Mr. Dax, and being bound by his certificate,
    as it is extremely distasteful to us that any doubt should exist in
    the minds of the vestry as to the propriety or amount of any item
    charged by us, which however there almost necessarily must be, from
    the technical manner in which solicitors are obliged to make out
    their bills.  We ought to add, that we have no sort of personal
    acquaintance with Mr. Dax, who is the son of the late Master of the
    Exchequer, and a well known author and authority on the subject of
    solicitors’ costs.  Should the vestry adopt our suggestion, we must
    ask to be allowed to make out the bills now before them, afresh, as
    they are not framed for taxation, and that in future, our bills
    should be delivered half-yearly and paid within a short time after
    they have been certified, and we remain, dear Sir, your’s faithfully,

                                                          LEE & PEMBERTON.

The vestry, having accepted the proposal, returned the bills to the
solicitors as desired, and requested Mr. Finch, a solicitor and a member
of the vestry, to attend the taxation.  This, after a strong protest from
the solicitors, he did; and the accounts amounting to £914. 3s. 5d., as
originally delivered, were settled by Mr. Dax at £998. 8s. 7d., including
the costs of taxation.

The law costs for the present year have been submitted to the same
process, and have been certified by Mr. Dax to be correct at the amount
at which they were sent in,—viz., £177. 1s. 6d.

Mr. Miles having been elected to preside at eighty-three meetings, out of
the one hundred and fifty-three held during the year, his services as
chairman were again acknowledged by a vote of thanks on the twenty-first
of May.  The thanks of the vestry have been also given during the year to
Mr. Perry on the eighth of May, for his exertions as delegate at the
metropolitan and county association for the equalization of the poor
rates; and to Mr. Foy on the fourth of December, for the tasteful way in
which the decorations of the vestry hall, on the occasion of the
inauguration dinner were carried out by him.



GENERAL WORKS.


Appendix No. 7 (pages 48–49), represents the cost, during the past year
under the several sub-heads of paving, lighting, watering, cleansing,
&c., and the provision made for meeting the same, by orders upon the
board of guardians.

The surveyor’s return upon this subject forms Appendix No. 8 (page 50).



PAVING.


The cost of the item of paving during the past year, exceeding the
estimate by four hundred and fifty pounds, has been unusually
heavy,—viz., £3042 2s. 10d., after allowing for the sum chargeable to the
several public companies and others for works executed for them.  This is
about twelve hundred and fifty pounds more than the cost of the same item
of expenditure in the year 1856–7, after making the same allowances;
upwards of four hundred pounds more than in 1857–8, eight hundred pounds
more than in 1858–9, and six hundred pounds more than last year.  It has
been occasioned mainly by the purchase of the following materials, and by
works executed in the places hereinafter named:—

In the last report it was stated that the question at issue between the
Chief Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c., and the vestry, as to the
taking charge and maintenance of the Chelsea Bridge Road, was in an
unsatisfactory state, and the position of that question was stated in the
appendix to the fourth report (No. 9), at pages 45 to 52, up to the
receipt of Mr. Austin’s letter of the 27th June, 1860.  The proceedings
since that date will be found in the Appendix to this report, No. 9
(pages 51 to 55).



LIGHTINGS


The Metropolis Gas Act received the royal assent on the 28th August,
1860: it contains fifty-seven clauses, many of them most important for
the protection of public and private consumers.  By the twenty-seventh
section of the act (23 & 24 Vic., cap. 125) the vestry are required to
provide apparatus for testing the illuminating power and purity of the
gas, and to appoint a competent person as examiner; and by the same
section the gas companies are required to erect, at a distance not less
than one thousand yards from their works, experimental meters with the
necessary apparatus for testing the illuminating power of the gas
supplied.  In alleged compliance with this requirement the London Gas
light company have appointed a testing station at the house No. 73,
Besborough Street, Pimlico.

Mr. Hughes {8} observes with reference to this twenty-seventh section,—

    “There was some discussion as to the propriety of making the
    requirements of this clause compulsory instead of merely permissive.
    After the fullest consideration however, it was thought essential,
    with the view of avoiding discussions in vestries, and especially
    with the view of counteracting the underhand and secret influence
    which the gas companies exert in many vestries and district boards,
    to make the clause compulsory.  There are many instances on record,
    where powers are given to local authorities, and yet these powers,
    although highly important to the public interests, have never
    hitherto been exercised.  Hence an additional reason for positively
    requiring them to provide apparatus, &c., for testing the gas, and to
    appoint and pay an inspector for the purpose.  It is true that no
    time is fixed within which the apparatus is to be provided and the
    inspector appointed, but I apprehend it will be competent for any
    ratepayer to compel, by mandamus, the performance of this duty by any
    vestry or district board, within a reasonable time.

    “The second section of the clause imposes an obligation on the gas
    companies—namely, that each of them shall within six months erect at
    the prescribed distance from their works, an experimental meter and
    other apparatus for testing the illuminating power of the gas.

    “Now these two obligations, the one on the local authorities of the
    metropolis, and the other on the gas companies, must not be
    confounded, because they are perfectly distinct, and the one is not
    to be a substitute for the other.  In the first place each local
    authority in the metropolis—_i.e._, each vestry and district board,
    about thirty-eight in number, constituted under the Metropolis Local
    Management Act, is to erect its own apparatus, and appoint its own
    inspector; and from future clauses it appears that the act
    contemplates a continuous and regular succession of testing by this
    inspector, both for purity and illuminating power.  The evidence of
    this inspector however as to any defects in the gas, will not be
    conclusive until his report has been confirmed by testing the gas at
    the prescribed distance of 1000 yards from the works.  Hence the
    necessity for the obligation on the company.  The next clause will
    better explain the mode of proceeding by the inspector, whenever he
    finds the gas to be below the prescribed standard of illuminating
    power.  With reference to purity there is nothing about testing for
    this at the distance of 1000 yards, and therefore the test for this
    may be made wherever the inspector pleases.

    “With respect to the number of separate places for testing the gas,
    inasmuch as there are thirteen companies included within the act, and
    each must provide a testing house 1000 yards distant from their
    works, there must evidently be not less than thirteen of these. {9}
    But if each local authority also erects a separate one at some
    central part of its district, thirty-eight of these will be
    necessary.  A power is afterwards given for two or more local
    authorities to combine, and then the number will probably be somewhat
    diminished.

    “All this necessity for a duplicate set of testing establishments is
    rendered essential by the absurd requirement of the act as to testing
    the gas at 1000 yards distance from the works.  Now as the erection
    of this apparatus by the companies and the establishment of a
    permanent testing place away from their works will be very expensive
    to the companies, it is just possible they may be very glad to be
    relieved from this expense, and may consent to the testing at the
    establishment of the local authority being sufficient evidence of the
    illuminating power as well as the purity of the gas.  This is the
    more probable as it must be perfectly well known to the companies—at
    least to their engineers—that so far as the company is concerned the
    gas may just as well be tested in the centre of any district
    supplied, as at the limited distance of 1000 yards from the works.”

Under the provisions of the fiftieth section of this act, the duty is
imposed upon the Metropolitan Board of Works of raising the costs and
charges incident to its passing; and that board have accordingly levied
under their precepts upon the several vestries and district boards, the
necessary amounts for meeting the claims received.

The accounts sent in by the various parties were submitted to the proper
officer of the House of Commons for taxation with the following result:—

    Accounts sent in.                               Amount Certified by     Costs Allowed.        Board to Pay.

The proportion of the above with which this parish is debited by the
precept of 1861 is £106 16s. 5d., but that proportion is based upon the
amount of the accounts as sent in; as reduced by taxation it will only be
£81 12s. 8d.  But as the vestry has already contributed two hundred
pounds to Mr. Beal in answer to his various appeals, and expended upwards
of twenty pounds in making experiments as suggested by him, they will
have a large sum to receive back

In November, 1860, a proposal was made by the vestry of St. James’,
Westminster, to recognize the services of Messrs. Beal and Hughes
throughout the enquiry into the supply of gas to the metropolis, and the
passing of the recent measure by raising some fitting testimonial, and a
committee of that vestry having been appointed to carry it out, Messrs.
Hall and Perry were deputed to confer with them as to the best mode of
doing so.

The Bill to amend the Metropolis Gas Act, {11} introduced by the
government into parliament for transferring to the metropolitan board of
works, so far as regards the metropolis, the powers conferred by the acts
for regulating measures used in the sale of gas (22 & 23 Vic., cap. 66,
and 23 & 24 Vic., cap. 146) upon the justices of the peace, of appointing
inspectors of meters, having received the royal assent (24 & 25 Vict.,
cap. 79), it will be the duty of that board to take the necessary steps
for carrying it into execution.  To aid in accomplishing this transfer,
the vestry on the tenth July, 1860, expressed their opinion that the
appointment of inspectors of meters in the metropolis would be best
placed in the hands of the metropolitan board of works, and petitioned
parliament and memorialised the justices of the peace upon the subject.
See Appendix No. 10 (page 56).

The number of public lamps in the parish on the 25th March, 1861, was as
follows—

Lighted by the London Gas Company      696
,, Western ditto at Kensal Town         30
                                       726

WATERING AND SCAVENGERS.


The following tabular statement shows the cost of these two services for
the last five years:—

From March to March.      Watering.            Cleansing.              Total.

The contractors were fined £40 10s. for neglect during the year.



IMPROVING.


The principal charges under this head are for works over the Ranelagh
sewer at Sloane Square in rebuilding the south wall; and in fencing the
enclosure opposite Royal Avenue Terrace.



REMOVING NUISANCES.


The removal of the dust, ashes and refuse from the houses of the
inhabitants, and the public courts and alleys during this year has cost
£311 2s.  An alteration in the form of the contract as to the mode of
executing the works by which the parish is divided into daily districts,
was made during this year, which has very greatly lessened the public
inconvenience, and consequently the number of complaints.  See Appendix
No. 11 (page 57).



SANITARY MEASURES.


The return of the proceedings taken by the vestry under the metropolis
local management act and the nuisances removal act, as required by the
former statute to be published, will be found in the Appendix No. 12
(page 60).

Forty-seven slaughter houses in the parish were licensed by the
magistrates in October, 1860, not one having been opposed by the vestry.
A list of them is given in the Appendix No. 13 (page 61).

The tenant of No. 3, Queen’s Road East, having been detected in
slaughtering upon his premises which were not licensed for that purpose,
the attention of the board was called to the subject, but as it appeared
that he had been acting under the impression that the premises were
licensed, in place of other proceedings, a letter of warning was written
to him, and the offence was discontinued.

The notices of the vestry having been neglected by Mr. Peter Augustus
Halahan, owner of Nos. 1 to 10, Wickham Place, application was made under
the nuisances removal act to the magistrate and his orders obtained for
the execution of the necessary works; these orders being also neglected
and nothing being done at the expiration of the time allowed, the clerk
was instructed to apply for the enforcement of the penalties provided by
the twenty-seventh section.  The defendant was fined thirty-six shillings
and costs, and in default of payment was committed to prison.

A manuscript copy of all the reports made to the vestry by the medical
officer of health during the year is sent to the metropolitan board of
works with a copy of this report.



GENERAL RATES.


The orders issued by the vestry, and the rates made by the overseers (the
board of guardians) thereunder during the year, have been as follows:—

Date and Amount of Order issued by the Vestry.    Date and Amount of      Rateable Value of         Gross Amount of

SEWERAGE WORKS.


Again no general sewers rate for local purposes having been made during
the year, there is a deficit upon this account, of one hundred and
fifty-five pounds nineteen shillings and one penny.

In the Appendix No. 14 (page 62), and No. 15 (page 63), will be found
statements giving particulars of a similar kind to those given under the
head of General Works.

The orders issued by the vestry for special sewers rates during the year,
and the rates made by the board of guardians in consequence, have been as
follows:—

APPLICATIONS.


During the period between the 26th March, 1860, and the 25th March, 1861,
the vestry have adjudicated upon forty-six applications for directions
upon the subject of house drainage, twenty-three of which had reference
to the drainage of twenty-five houses already built, and twenty-three to
forty-three intended houses and the new barracks at Pimlico; they have
also brought under the cognisance of the Commissioners of Police, the
dangerous condition of forty-five buildings, and have decided upon
seventeen miscellaneous applications.  Of the applications so made,
fifty-nine have been granted, and four negatived.

Eight buildings have been commenced without previous notice to the
vestry, and their builders having been summoned before the board for
neglect, the explanations given by them, or their apologies, have in most
cases been considered satisfactory.  Fourteen proposals have been made to
build before the general frontage line, and one hundred and three
obstructions and offences upon the public highway have been dealt with by
the Board.



THE LATE HANS TOWN COMMISSION, AND THE LATE CHELSEA IMPROVEMENT
COMMISSION.


Nos. 16 and 17 in the Appendix (page 64), explain the alteration which
these debts have undergone during the year.

No special rate has been necessary upon the Hans Town district, during
the past twelvemonth, but the order and rate made for the reduction of
the debt upon the remainder of the parish has been as follows:—

   Date and Amount of      Date and Amount of     Rateable Value of     Gross Amount of Rate.

VESTRY HALL.


The first meeting of the vestry in the new building took place on the
ninth of October, 1860, and shortly afterwards it was determined to
celebrate the public opening of the large hall with an inauguration
dinner.  A committee being formed for the purpose the necessary
arrangements were made, and on the thirtieth of November one hundred and
twenty of the most influential parishioners, presided over by Viscount
Chelsea, with the county members as their guests, commemorated the
completion of a building, which it may be permitted the vestry to hope,
will be of service to the ratepayers and the parish.  The report and
balance sheet of the dinner committee is printed in the Appendix No. 18
(pages 65–66).

After the dinner the first public use of the hall was given gratuitously
on three days to the Chelsea, Brompton, and Belgrave Dispensary, and by
means of an oratorio, “The Creation,” on one day; a lecture by the Rev.
J. B. Owen, of St. Jude’s Church, on another; and a concert on a third
day, that useful local charity realised nearly one hundred pounds.

Having obtained a license for public music and dancing, the applications
for the hire of the hall were soon found to be so numerous that a
committee was appointed to regulate the letting, and they drew up the
scale of charges which was approved by the vestry, and will be found at
page 67.  A debtor and creditor account in connexion with the letting of
the hall will be also found at pages 68–69.

One of the most important applications referred to the letting committee
was from the proposed Literary and Scientific Institution, that the suite
of rooms on the east side of the building might be set apart for their
use.  The letting committee made a special report upon the subject, to
the vestry on the eighteenth December, and a deputation from the council
of the institution, consisting of the Rev. F. Blunt, Messrs. McCullagh,
Lawrance and Mead, with Mr. Bull, the honorary secretary, had an
interview with the vestry.  The report which is printed at page 70, read
in connection with the following resolution which was passed by the
vestry, will explain the nature of the engagement subsisting between the
two bodies:—“Resolved, that the suite of rooms upon the ground floor
(east side) including the lighting and warming of the same, and the use
of the Hall for forty nights during the year, including the lighting,
warming, and cleaning of the same, be let to the council of the
Institution for £50 per annum, payable half-yearly, from Christmas next.
The tenancy to be subject to six months’ notice of determination by
either party at any time.” A debtor and creditor account for one winter
quarter will be found at page 74.

Upon the application of the vestry, Sir R. Mayne, the chief commissioner
of police, appointed a standing for ten cabs at the King’s Road end of
Robert Street, exactly opposite the hall; but unfortunately the
post-office authorities were unable to comply with their request that a
pillar letter box might be placed near to the hall.

The vestry hall buildings are insured in the Union Assurance Office for
six thousand pounds; and the fixtures, fittings, and furniture, in the
Manchester Fire Assurance Office for seven hundred pounds.

Ten thousand pounds, the sum originally borrowed, not having been
sufficient to complete the building together with the fitting and
furnishing, an application was made to the metropolitan board of works
for their sanction to a further loan of two thousand pounds; and as it
was necessary to accompany that application with a statement of the
entire estimated cost, and to fortify it with a memorial from the vestry,
those documents, as they contain much matter of interest, are printed at
pages 75 and 72–73.



COUNTER’S CREEK DISTRICT.


Since the last report the sum assessed by the metropolitan board of works
upon this portion of the parish has been, for the year 1861, four hundred
and seventy-nine pounds, eleven shillings and eleven pence; but the
vestry have abstained from issuing their order to the board of guardians
for its collection.  They have, however, in consequence of the receipt of
the following letter, upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee,
paid the amount for 1858:—

                                              Metropolitan Board of Works,
                                                1, Greek Street, Soho, W.,
                                                       17th October, 1860,

    Dear Sir,—I am directed by the metropolitan board of works to
    acquaint you that they have directed their attention to the subject
    of the amounts outstanding on their precepts issued to the vestries
    and district boards of the metropolis, and they desire me to apprize
    you for the information of the vestry of Chelsea, that having been
    unsuccessful in their attempt to carry a measure through Parliament
    in the past session for conferring upon the board the necessary
    powers to deal with the question of the redistribution of the
    Counter’s Creek charges, they have had under consideration the
    subject of the payment of the amount due from the vestry on the
    precept for the ordinary expenses of the board for the year 1858,
    being the sum of £447 4_s._ 2_d._ payment of which was, as you will
    recollect, allowed to stand over until the re-apportionments of the
    debts of the Commissioners of Sewers had been discussed in
    Parliament.  The board now feel that the time has arrived when it is
    necessary that they should adopt measures for obtaining payments of
    the amounts outstanding, and after an attentive consideration of the
    facts of the case, and having regard to the arrangement with the
    vestry in reference to the parish contributing to the cost of the
    Counter’s Creek diversion sewer, the conclusion they have arrived at
    as to the most convenient course to be adopted is, that the board
    should proceed to appoint persons to make a rate on the parish in
    default, for the amount due on the precept, and in the event of the
    vestry continuing their objection to the payment, that some ratepayer
    should then raise the question of the liability of the parish by an
    appeal against the rate, on which a special case might be reserved
    for the opinion of the Court of Queen’s Bench.  I am directed to add
    that the Board have deferred further proceedings in the matter for a
    fortnight from the date of their last meeting, the 12th instant, in
    order to afford the vestry an opportunity of paying the amount in
    question should they think proper so to do; and meanwhile I am to
    request that you will be good enough to lay this letter before the
    vestry, and to favor me with a reply with the least possible delay.
    I am, dear sir, yours faithfully, JOHN POLLARD, Clerk of the Board.

The amount assessed for 1859, four hundred and fifty-six pounds, nine
shillings and one penny, was paid by order of the board on the sixth
December, 1859, before any portion of it was received from the board of
guardians.

January, 1861, the metropolitan board were very pressing for payment of
the amount for 1860 (five hundred and eighteen pounds, nineteen
shillings, and one penny), threatening immediate proceedings if it were
not made before the 25th of that month; the vestry, however, appealed
through Mr Tite against this undue pressure, contrasting with it, the
treatment received by the vestry of Kensington, who were in arrear many,
if not all, of their instalments, and eventually the metropolitan board
consented to receive the amount of the precept for their ordinary
expenses of 1860 less this sum which was included in it.  Thus it is that
the sums assessed for the first four years have been collected in the
district, and paid to the metropolitan board; but for the two last, 1860
and 1861, they have not been paid to the metropolitan board, nor have any
steps been taken to collect the money in the district.



METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS.


The estimate upon which the sums were originally proposed to be raised by
the metropolitan board of works for the services of the year ending the
thirty-first of December, 1860, gives the following particulars as
applicable to this parish:—

                                    £      _s._   _d._
Sewerage and Drainage                1168     17      1

General Purposes, viz.:—
     Salaries, Wages, &c.             271     16      8
     Printing, Stationery, &c.         45     14      6
     Rent, Taxes, &c.                  23      9      0
Repayment of Loans, &c., special:—
     Principal                        283     12      5
     Interest                         272     17      5
Ditto ditto, general:—
     Clergy Mutual, £140,000          255     15      2
     Bank of England, £400,000        351     14     10
     Clergy Mutual, £42,000            31     16      1
     Contingencies                     40      0     11
                                    £3156     19      3

This estimate, however, having been printed and sent to the various
vestries and district boards, underwent considerable discussion and some
modifications, the principal of which latter, were, that instead of
including the whole cost of the new buildings in Spring Gardens in the
precepts for 1860, it was determined to spread it over three years; an
item of £20,000 for deodorization was reduced to £10,000; the amount for
special charges was reduced by £5,000; and the sum of £2,000 was
substituted for £5,000 for minor improvements.  These alterations, with a
credit of £364 10s. 10d. (the remaining portion of the £3053 16s. 3d.
adverted to in former reports), had the effect of diminishing the amount
required from this parish to £2239 10s. 9d., and it was thus apportioned
by the precept dated 11th May, 1860:—

                                 £      _s._   _d._
The Whole Parish                  1004     13      3
The Counters Creek District        518     19      1
The Ranelagh District              715     18      5
                                 £2239     10      9

In September, the third precept for the Main Drainage rate was received,
amounting to £2928 2s.; and in the following February the ordinary
precept for 1861, £2580 1s. 4d.; therefore within the period comprised in
this report this parish has been required to provide for metropolitan
purposes the large sum of £7,747 14s. 1d.

The orders made by the vestry in pursuance of these precepts, and the
rates made by the board of guardians thereunder, are shewn in the
following table:—

The metropolitan board of works early in February of the present year
determined to re-introduce into parliament the bill for amending the
Metropolis Local Management Act, containing the same provisions as were
in the bill of last session, with the exception of the introduction of
certain clauses for the re-apportionment of the Rock Loan; but in
consequence of the strong opposition to those clauses, the board deemed
it expedient to withdraw them from the bill, and to embody them in a
separate bill, and the two bills were accordingly introduced into the
House of Commons.  The first of them, after great delays, passed through
the House of Commons on the nineteenth of July, 1861, and was read a
first time in the House of Lords on the twenty-second of that month, but
in consequence of the advanced period of the session, it was found
impossible to procure its passage through the required stages in order to
its becoming law this year.  The bill No. 2, having relation to the Rock
Loan, being strongly opposed by certain members of the House of Commons,
was withdrawn.

With respect to the abortive bill of 1860, the solicitors of the
metropolitan board reported: “We think it will be nearly correct to
estimate the expense to the board, exclusive of printing, &c. by the
printers of the board, and expenses of that kind, at about £1650.”  It is
to be hoped that the failure of 1861 will be somewhat less costly.

The vestry of Chelsea have at various times responded to the invitation
of the metropolitan board for suggestions during the preparation of the
several bills for amending the Metropolis Local Management Act; for
convenience of reference, their labours in this respect will be found in
the Appendix No. 19, (pages 77 to 103).



CHELSEA CHARITIES.


On the twenty-second of May, 1860, upon the motion of Mr. Finch, a
committee, consisting of the rector (the Rev. A. G. W. Blunt), the
churchwardens (Dr. Diplock and Mr. Collier), three past churchwardens
(Messrs. Hall, Perry, and Leete), and Messrs. Whitehead, Jones, Miles,
Brown, Rabbits, E. O. Symons, Till, and Finch, was appointed to enquire
into the charities of the parish, the present particulars of the several
properties, and the application of the respective annual proceeds
thereof, and to report thereon.  At the same time, the vestry clerk
reported that, at the request of the rector, he was making arrangements
preliminary to the appointment of new trustees, and laid before the
vestry the following letter from Mr. Druce:

                                                                Mr. Lahee,

    Dear Sir, Doubtless you are aware that the information contained in
    last Saturday’s “Chelsea Times” {20} was provided by me, as far as
    concerned the Chelsea charities.

    The article of this morning {20} would lead me to suppose that it was
    taken to be the opinion of the writer of such information that under
    present circumstances it would be to the advantage of the parish that
    the vestry clerk should be a solicitor; nothing can be more foreign
    to my opinion, and without compliment, I think the office is now in
    very good hands.  In the wicked old tory times on Easter Tuesday, a
    man might blow out the steam of discontent, and tell a few truths
    profitable to the parish to hear; now a few highly honourable and
    sensible parishioners ‘make things pleasant’ in a comfortable room in
    a house in the King’s Road.  The money of the parish charities is not
    properly looked after; for many months I have been trying to get the
    late rector to put matters to rights, but without avail.  Being
    therefore left sole trustee for some portion, and knowing more than
    most, about the parish school and trust funds, I thought I was the
    proper person to light the match.  Should the vestry appoint the
    committee on charity affairs, I shall be happy to attend their
    summons to give them any information in my power: and I think they
    ought to have a committee, both on this subject and that of the
    church trustees, and at least chronicle the exact state of facts;
    for, seriously speaking, we owe ‘liberal opinions’ no small grudge
    for shutting up Easter Tuesday.  I do not recollect that in your
    charity report {21} you mentioned the large sums belonging to the
    charity schools, if you did, the vestry ought to have seen that the
    trustees were dying out.  From my experience of the working of the
    parish charities, schools, &c., I am quite convinced that the vestry
    should annually qualify themselves to issue a report on all charity
    money.  I have never found anything to make me think otherwise than
    favourably of the honesty of all dealings with the charity money, but
    I have found abundant reason to rest satisfied, that without some lay
    assistance and watchfulness, all matters get into disorder,
    especially where there are any accounts to keep.  This letter is at
    your service, and may be used as you think fit.  I am, dear sir,
    always yours very faithfully, WM. DRUCE.  Swan Wharf, Chelsea, 14th
    April, 1860.

The committee, favoured occasionally with the assistance of Mr. Druce,
and strengthened by the addition to it of Messrs. Butt, Tipper, and
Callow, have met upon numerous occasions, and are carefully pursuing
their enquiry.



CREMORNE GARDENS.


It will be recollected that towards the close of the season of 1858, the
vestry thought it necessary to remind Mr. Simpson, the proprietor of
Cremorne Gardens, of the arrangement made with them as to the conduct of
his gardens, particularly as to the hour of closing; and that Mr.
Simpson’s reply, although dated the 16th of August, was not received in
sufficient time to be considered until the meeting on the fifth of
October, when it was thought to be unsatisfactory.  Last year the vestry
again moved in the matter, by reminding him of these promises, and
requesting to know before Monday, the tenth of September, whether it was
his intention to comply with their wishes and those of the parish, by
closing the gardens at twelve o’clock at night.  No reply having been
received from Mr. Simpson at the meeting of the board on the eleventh of
September, it was moved by Mr. Delany that the report of the second of
November, 1857, which the vestry had refrained from making public in
consequence of the pledge on the part of the proprietor, that the gardens
should be closed as near to midnight as possible, and that in other
respects he would meet the wishes of the vestry, and the comfort of the
inhabitants, should be printed for the use of the vestry.  The chairman,
however, having ruled that this motion was irregular, it was referred to
the committee of works and for general purposes to consider the whole
question, particularly with reference to the effect, a change in the
proprietorship, from an individual to a company, might have in increasing
the annoyance of the parishioners; and the report of the committee was
presented on the twenty-fifth of September.

That report, which is printed at page 107, recommended the publication of
the report of 1857, and the presentation of a petition to the licensing
magistrates that the hour of closing might be made twelve o’clock at
night, as was the case with other public gardens.  A memorial from
forty-four owners of property and ratepayers residing near the gardens,
urging the vestry to act, was presented at the same time the report was
under consideration.

The vestry then decided, by a majority of 17 to 6, to present the
petition, but to withold the publication of the report of 1857; and the
solicitor being in attendance with a form of petition, which was
approved, the seal was affixed to it at once, and it was duly presented.

On the ninth of October, however, a day or two before the licensing day,
a communication was received from the solicitors, which induced the
board, on a division, by a majority of twenty-eight to eight, to pass the
following resolution:—

    Resolved, that having regard to the communication now made by the
    solicitors, from which it appears that the necessary evidence in
    support of the petition cannot be obtained upon the present occasion,
    the solicitors be instructed not to incur any further expense in the
    matter, on the understanding that if the gardens should be kept open
    after twelve at night, and the nuisance, annoyance, and injury to the
    parishioners continue, this board, will in sufficient time next year
    consider the necessary steps to be taken effectually to oppose the
    application for the renewal of the license in 1861.



“THE LOTS.”


“The Lots,” a parcel of land so called lying on the banks of the river
{23a} in front of Ashburnham House, comprises about four acres, and is
the meadow ground formerly allotted to Sir Arthur Gorges by the Lord of
the Manor, in lieu of his right of common. {23b}  These are, and have
been for centuries, the Chelsea Lammas Lands, and have hitherto been
accustomed to be opened on the twelfth of August, being the first day of
the month according to the Old Style.  The graziers, butchers, and
others, with their cattle, used formerly to assemble in the lane leading
to “The Lots” on the eve of Lammas, and when the clock had struck twelve
they entered upon the meadow.

From the report of a committee, printed at page 108, appointed by the
vestry in the year 1834 to investigate the state of these town meadows,
when it was necessary _vi et armis_ to reassert the invaded privileges of
the inhabitants, it appears that “‘The Lots’ are Lammas land, and have
been for ages appurtenant to the manor of Chelsea.  The Lord of the Manor
possesses the right of letting the land on lease for the spring and
autumn quarters, beginning with March and ending in August; and the
inhabitants at large enjoy the privilege of turning in their cattle from
August till February, being the autumn and winter quarters.”  Railways,
however, and acts of parliament for smoothing down difficulties in their
way, have sprung up since those pastoral clays; and the Lord of the Manor
having sold his freehold to a railway company, the clerk called the
attention of the vestry, on the 8th of May, 1860, to the following
advertisement:—

    West London Extension Railway Company.—Notice is hereby given, that a
    Meeting of the Householders, Inhabitants, and Land-owners of the
    Parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex, and other
    persons interested in the Lammas Lands called “The Lots,” in the said
    Parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, will be held at the house of Mr. John
    Sparks Alexander situate in Cremorne Road, in the said parish, and
    known by the name or sign of the ‘King’s Arms,’ on Wednesday, the 9th
    day of May next, at Eleven o’clock in the forenoon, for the purpose
    of appointing a Committee to treat with the Company for the
    compensation to be paid by them for the extinction of the Lammas and
    other Commonable Rights, in or over certain land called ‘The Lots’ in
    the said parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, and which is required by the
    Company for the purposes of the ‘West London Extension Railway.  Act,
    1859.’—Dated the 27th day of April, 1860.—EDWARD BELLAMY, Secretary
    of the Company.

A meeting took place consequently on the 9th of May, at which the
following resolution was passed:—

    Resolved, that Messrs. William Hall (church warden), John Perry,
    James Miles, George Wevell Richards, and William Whitehead, being
    five of the persons entitled to Lammas or other Commonable Rights
    over or in the piece of land called ‘The Lots Meadow,’ otherwise
    ‘Chelsea Lot Mead,’ situate in the parish of Saint Luke, Chelsea, in
    the County of Middlesex, and containing by admeasurement three acres,
    two roods, and thirty perches, or thereabouts, and marked or referred
    to in the map or plan, and in the book of reference of the West
    London Extension Railway, deposited with the Clerk of the Peace for
    the said County of Middlesex, by the number 10 in the said parish of
    St. Luke, Chelsea, shall be, and they are accordingly, in pursuance
    of the provisions of the ‘Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845,’
    appointed to be a Committee having all such powers as by the ‘Lands
    Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845’ are conferred upon Committees of
    like description, to treat with the West London Extension Railway
    Company for the compensation to be paid for the extinction of all
    Lammas or other Commonable Rights over or in the said piece of land.

The important question of the boundaries of the parish has occupied
considerable attention during the past year, and has been the subject of
a reference to a sub-committee of the committee of works and for general
purposes, who have still the subject under consideration.

Various memorials and petitions have been presented during the year, to
which, as they sufficiently elucidate the subjects of them, and are
printed in the appendix (Nos. 23 to 27) no further allusion need be made
here.

The “Public Indicator” erected in Sloane Square by permission of the
board in May, 1860, was removed in the fallowing March, in consequence of
the failure of the proprietors to light it at night, and to provide the
promised clock.  It is retained in the custody of the vestry, under a
clause in the agreement, as a lien for the expenses of its removal and
making good the paving.

Plans, books of reference, and parliamentary notices of the “London,
Buckinghamshire, and West Midland Railway” (whose intended terminus was
in the Pavilion grounds), and of “The London Tramway and Dispatch
Company,” were deposited with the Vestry, but both of their bills were
unsuccessful.  Mr. Train also made an application to the vestry for
permission to lay down his tramways in Sloane Street and the King’s Road,
but its consideration has been adjourned _sine die._

On the twenty-ninth of January, 1861, Mr. Finch laid before the Board a
copy of a “Bill to Transfer the Seats in Parliament forfeited by the
Borough of St. Albans to the proposed Borough of Chelsea and Kensington,”
which Viscount Enfield, M.P. for Middlesex had given notice of his
intention to introduce in the House of Commons.  Immediately the
Government {25} brought in their “Bill for the Appropriation of the Seats
Vacated by the Disfranchisement of the Boroughs of Sudbury and Saint
Albans,” which contained the following clause: “The parishes of Chelsea
and Kensington in the county of Middlesex shall, for the purposes of this
act, together form a borough, to be called the borough of Chelsea, and
such borough shall, from and after the said first day of November, 1861,
return one member to serve in parliament.”

An influential deputation from both parishes, accompanied by the two
county members, had an interview with Lord Palmerston on the fifth of
March, on the subject of the bill, and laid before his lordship various
statistical information (see appendix No. 29).  But on a division in the
House of Commons on the tenth of June, the clause was rejected by a
majority of two hundred and seventy-five to one hundred and seventy-two.
Mr. Tite thus reported the circumstance to the board:—

                                                       42, Lowndes Square,
                                               Tuesday Morning, 1 o’clock.

    My dear Mr. Lahee,—I never was so taken by surprise as by the
    division I have just left.  The Government Bill was affirmed by two
    large majorities, but when we came to the Chelsea question, to my
    astonishment we were beaten by one hundred and three.  The house was
    excessively impatient, and would hardly listen to anything; but it
    appeared to me Sir James Graham, whom they would hear, said all that
    could be said on the subject.  I was also astonished at some of those
    I saw voting against us.  I will send you the division list as soon
    as I get it.  The impression in the House _just now_ was that the
    bill would be withdrawn, so in happier times we may have another
    chance.—Yours very truly,

                                                             WILLIAM TITE.

    P.S.—Rather sharp work for M.P.’s yesterday.  I was on a committee
    from 12 to 4, in the House from 5 to just now; to-day we begin again
    at 12, I suppose until 2 o’clock Wednesday morning.



                                                   By order of the Vestry,
                                                            CHARLES LAHEE,
                                                           _Vestry Clerk_.

Sir,—The attention of the First Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c.,
having been drawn to the bad state of that portion of the road, leading
from Lower Sloane-street to the New Suspension Bridge, which is in the
parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, I am directed by him to request that you
will move the Vestry of that parish to cause immediate measures to be
taken for putting the above mentioned portion of the said road into a
proper state of repair.

                                                                I am, Sir,

Sir,—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
5th instant, by direction of the First Commissioner, requesting that the
portion of the Chelsea Bridge Road in this parish may be properly
repaired, and to inform you that it will be laid before the Vestry on
Tuesday next, the 12th instant.

                                                                I am, Sir,

Sir,—With reference to the Board’s letter of the 5th ultimo, and your
reply of the 7th ult., respecting the state of the portion of the Chelsea
Bridge Road, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, I am directed by the
First Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c., to send you, herewith,
copies of a letter of yesterday’s date, and of its enclosure from the
Commissioners of Metropolitan Police on the subject of that road, and to
request that you will lay the same before the Vestry.

                                                                I am, Sir,

Sir,—I feel it my duty to transmit the enclosed report from the
Superintendent B Division of Police, relative to the state of the
carriage road leading to the New Chelsea Bridge.

                                                                I am, &c.,

I beg to report that that part of the carriage road leading to Chelsea
New Bridge which is within the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, is in a very
dirty state and full of ruts; it is very dangerous, and quite unfit for
public traffic.  This road was formed by the Board of Works, and has not
yet been taken charge of by the parish of St. Luke.  There has been some
correspondence between the parish and the Board, but nothing definite has
been come to.

                                                     (Signed) G. M. GIBBS,

                           CHELSEA BRIDGE ROAD.

Sir,—The Vestry of this parish will meet to-morrow, when I shall have the
honor to lay before them your letter of the 6th instant.

Your letter of the 5th ultimo, was placed before the Vestry held on the
12th ultimo, and then referred to the Committee of Works and for General
Purposes, by whom it is still under consideration.

                                              I have the honor to be, Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,

Sir,—The enclosed report from the Superintendent of the B Division is
transmitted for the information of the Vestry of the parish of Chelsea,
that they may give such directions thereon, as they consider proper.

                                                                I am, Sir,

In reference to my report of the 4th instant, respecting the state of the
carriage road leading to the New Chelsea Bridge, I omitted to state that
a portionof the road, viz., from Queen’s-road East to the
Commercial-road, a distance of 374 yards, is without gas lamps, or light
of any kind at night, rendering it a very dangerous thoroughfare, and
affording great facility for depredations to be committed.  I also beg to
mention that Her Majesty, when in town, frequently passes along this road
on her way to the new park at Battersea.

                                                              G. M. GIBBS,

                           CHELSEA BRIDGE ROAD.

Sir,—In acknowledging the receipt of your communication of the 9th inst.
I beg to inform you that the subject to which it relates will be brought
before the Vestry at its next meeting.

                                              I have the honor to be, Sir,

                                                             Vestry Clerk.

Sir R. Mayne, Chief Commissioner of Police.



                   _Vestry Clerk to A. Austin_, _Esq._

                                                         April 26th, 1861.

                           CHELSEA BRIDGE ROAD.

Sir,—Your letters of the 5th ultimo, and 6th instant, the former
requesting that the portion of the road leading to Chelsea Bridge, in
this parish, may be immediately put into a proper state of repair, and
the latter transmitting a report of the Police to the First Commissioner
of Her Majesty’s Works, &c., upon the same subject, having been referred
by the Vestry to their Committee of Works and for General Purposes, have,
together with the former correspondence, and proceedings in this matter,
received their careful consideration.

In addition to the above mentioned two letters, the Committee also had
before them a letter from Sir Richard Mayne, dated the 9th instant,
enclosing a further report from Superintendent Gibbs, omitted from his
former report above alluded to.

The Committee having reported their annexed resolution, and the Vestry
having approved of the same, I am directed to request that you will lay
the same before the First Commissioner.

Resolved,—That the First Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c., be
informed that the Committee agree with him as to the bad state of that
portion of the road leading to Chelsea Bridge, lying in this parish,
which is probably owing to the manner in which it was originally made up,
and to the works which have been lately executed there; and as the First
Commissioner is aware of the difference of opinion which exists as to the
legal obligations of his department on the one hand, and of the Vestry of
Chelsea on the other, with respect to this portion of the road, he be
again urged, as he was twelve months ago, to concur with the Vestry in
adopting some inexpensive and expeditious mode of bringing the questions
in difference before a competent tribunal for final decision.

                                              I have the honor to be, Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

Sir,—I am directed by the First Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c.,
to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, containing
a copy of a resolution of the Vestry of the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea,
respecting the portion of the road leading to Chelsea Bridge, which is in
that parish, and I am to state that the Board must deny that the bad
state of the road is ‘owing to the manner in which it was originally made
up,’ that with regard to ‘the works lately executed there,’ if, as the
Board presume, the Vestry allude to the formation of a sewer, those works
were not done by, or with the consent of this department; and that
although the Board are advised that the parish are liable to the repair
and maintenance of the road, and have no claim on the Board in respect
thereof, they are willing, with a view of avoiding expense to both
parties, to consider any proposition which the Vestry may submit to them
for having the matter settled by a competent tribunal.

                                                                 I am Sir,

                                                                Secretary.

                           CHELSEA BRIDGE ROAD.

Sir,—Referring to your letter of the 1st instant, I am directed to send
you copy of a resolution of the Committee of Works and for General
Purposes, which has been subsequently approved by the Vestry.

Resolved,—That this Committee recommend the Vestry to reply to the letter
from the Office of Works, &c., that the Board are still willing to agree
to the proposition made by this Vestry to the First Commissioner of Her
Majesty’s Works, &c., in February, 1860, for the purpose of having the
question decided by a court of competent jurisdiction at the smallest
expense, and with the least delay.

                                              I have the honor to be, Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE.

Sir,—I am directed by the First Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c.,
to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant,
transmitting copy of a resolution of the Committee of Works and General
Purposes of St. Luke, Chelsea, approved by the Vestry in regard to the
portion of the Chelsea Bridge Road, in that parish, and I am to state
that this Board are advised by counsel that a mandamus against the
parochial authorities will be the proper course to be adopted to compel
the performance by the latter of the duties which the legislature has
imposed upon them with respect to the road in question; but that if the
parochial authorities think that the matter in dispute can be more
speedily and satisfactorily settled, and at less expense by means of a
special case, and will be good enough to transmit to this Board the draft
of such a case, it shall receive immediate attention; the bad state of
the road makes it, however, not merely desirable but necessary, that the
opinion of a court of competent jurisdiction should be obtained as soon
as possible.

                                                                I am, Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                            ALFRED AUSTIN,
                                                                Secretary.

APPENDIX No. 10
LIGHTING.


              _To the Justices for the County of Middlesex_.

The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea in the County of
Middlesex,

SHEWETH,

That an Act was passed in the Session of Parliament one thousand eight
hundred and fifty-nine, intituled ‘An Act for Regulating Measures used in
the Sales of Gas.’

By that Act provision was made for securing to every consumer of gas
throughout the kingdom an accurate instrument of measurement for the gas
he had to pay for, which was most grievously required by the community,
and the means appointed for applying the benefits of that Act to the very
large body of gas consumers in the county of Middlesex, is that the
justices of the county should appoint an inspector or inspectors, and
determine the number of copies of the model gasholders to be stamped at
the Exchequer Office for the use of such inspectors.

In the Session of one thousand eight hundred and sixty another Act was
passed, intituled ‘An Act to amend the Act for Regulating Measures used
in the Sales of Gas,’ whereby the time for the previous Act to take
effect, with respect to the appointment of inspectors and some other
matters, was extended, and it was provided that the previous Act should
not come into operation in any county in England until the magistrates of
such county, in quarter sessions, should have resolved to bring such
county under the operation of the Act.

Your memorialists are informed that the magistrates or justices of
Middlesex have not only failed to take any steps whatever towards giving
the metropolis the benefit of correct measurement of gas, but have
absolutely refused to do so.

By the Amendment Act making the application of the law optional in
counties as contradistinguished from boroughs it was only intended to
relieve rural districts, where little or no gas is consumed, from the
expense of having inspectors in those districts, but there is nothing in
the Amendment Act to make it optional in boroughs; and your memorialists
do not call upon the justices of Middlesex to enforce it in the rural
districts, but in the densely populated metropolitan boroughs, and some
parishes.

If the justices do nevertheless consider that the option of bringing the
Act into operation in the metropolitan boroughs rests with them, the
public necessity for it is so great that they are bound in the
conscientious discharge of their magisterial duty to do all that is
necessary for that purpose.

Your memorialists therefore respectfully suggest and fervently hope that
your Worships will immediately proceed to carry into effect the said Act
within the boroughs of Marylebone, Finsbury, Tower Hamlets, Lambeth,
Southwark, and City of Westminster, and parishes not included in any
parliamentary borough, such as St. Luke, Chelsea, Hammersmith, and
Kensington.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, this 21st day of May,
1861,

                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

APPENDIX No. 18.
THE VESTRY HALL.


                     REPORT OF THE DINNER COMMITTEE.

                                          Vestry Hall, January 15th, 1861.

                _To the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea_.

Gentlemen,—We, the subscribers hereto, members of your committee
appointed to carry out the arrangements for giving proper effect to your
resolution of the 23rd October last, to inaugurate the opening of this
hall with a public dinner, have the pleasure to present the following
brief account of our stewardship.

As so many of you were present upon the occasion, it is almost
superfluous to say more than that it was attended by one hundred and
twenty persons, many of them the most influential in the parish, and that
it passed off, we hope and believe, to the general satisfaction of the
guests.

We annex a financial statement for your information, from which it
appears that the receipts from the sale of tickets were £113 8s., and the
cost of the dinner and wines £113 12s., the two amounts as nearly as
possible balancing each other.

The incidental expenses, for music, printing, toastmaster, a supper for
the workmen, &c., amounted to £26 10s. 9d., which by the kind feeling of
Mr. Pitt, of Cheyne-walk, has been reduced to the balance of £21 14s.
9d., a sum which we now ask at your hands.

Respectfully submitted,

                                                               JAS. MILES,

                                                                JOHN TILL,

REPORT OF THE LETTING COMMITTEE RESPECTING THE CHELSEA LITERARY AND
SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION.


                                              Committee Room, Vestry Hall,
                                                     18th, December; 1860.

                _To the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea_.

GENTLEMEN,—

We the undersigned of your Committee, for Letting, &c., the Hall, beg to
present this further Report with respect to the application of the
Honorary Secretaries of the proposed Literary and Scientific Institution,
which you referred to us from the Committee of Works and for General
Purposes, on the 16th October (1).

On the 20th of October Mr. Bull attended us and explained his views, and
followed up that interview with a letter, which was before us on the 19th
November, in which, on behalf of the Council, he thanked the Vestry for
the liberal manner in which they received the application for setting
apart a suite of rooms, with the use of the Hall, for the purposes of the
intended Institution.  The letter proceeded:—

    The Council sincerely rejoice in the view taken by the Vestry of the
    utility and benefit of such an institution to the whole body of
    ratepayers, and whilst they would desire to fix their home in the new
    Vestry Hall as a central point for their members, they do not for one
    moment expect that any of the necessary expenses incidental to the
    use and occupation of the rooms and hall should fall upon the
    ratepayers, but the Council will most readily be prepared to pay
    every such charge arising from the lighting, warming, or cleansing of
    the same.

    The Council are anxious to make the Institution a credit and a
    benefit to the whole body of parishioners, and by fixing a low rate
    of subscription, to enable every person, however humble his position,
    to become a member, should he have the inclination to avail himself
    of its privileges.  The rate of subscription to a large proportion of
    the members would not exceed 3d. per week, the highest being one
    guinea per annum.

In reply we informed Mr. Bull “that we were of opinion that £30 per annum
(being the interest upon £1000) would be a fair sum, alike equitable to
the members of the Institution and the ratepayers, to be paid as rent for
the suite of rooms and the use of the hall one evening in the week, the
Institution themselves bearing the incidental expenses of lighting,
warming, and cleansing the same, as stated in his note.  That if the
council agree to those terms, and will make a proposal to that effect, we
would lay it before the Vestry for their approval.”

The Council then addressed to us the following letter, to which we have
given the most attentive consideration:—

                                             “19, Walpole Street, Chelsea,
                                                         December 3, 1860.

    To the Committee of the New Vestry Hall, Chelsea,—Gentlemen,—We beg
    to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and to
    thank you for allowing our Council the use of your room for their
    weekly meetings.

    The Council have taken into consideration the proposal of the Vestry
    Committee for letting them the suite of rooms and use of the hall for
    £30 per annum, as a rent for the same, besides paying all expenses
    incurred for cleansing, warming, and lighting.

    The Council are apprehensive that this proposal may prove a stumbling
    block to their future progress!

    The object of the promoters of the Institution was, to establish a
    Literary and Scientific Society so comprehensive in its objects, and
    at the same time so accessible to all classes, that it might possess
    almost all the advantages of a free library, without its
    inconveniences.

    To accomplish this desirable end, the Council fixed a low rate of
    subscription, so that the industrious mechanic might share the
    advantages of the Institution, in common with all the other classes
    of the inhabitants.

    In order however to meet the views of the Vestry Committee, so far as
    the faithful carrying out of the above purpose will permit, and also
    to expedite the arrangement between the Vestry and the Council, the
    following resolution was agreed to at a special meeting of the
    Council on Thursday evening last, the Rev. Frederick Blunt in the
    chair:—

    “Resolved,—That in answer to the letter of the Vestry Committee of
    the 21st instant, the following proposal be submitted in lieu of that
    contained their letter:—

    “‘That the sum of £40 per annum be offered to the Vestry Committee as
    the utmost that the Council can give consistently with the avowed
    objects of the Institution, this sum to include the use and
    occupation of the three rooms, with conveniences, on the ground floor
    of the building, and use of the large hall once a week, together with
    all expenses incurred for lighting and warming, the Council taking
    upon themselves to keep in order the three rooms, leaving the
    cleansing of the large hall in the hands of the Vestry.’

    “The Council trust that the Vestry will take an enlarged and liberal
    view of this proposition; and whilst the stated rent of £30 per annum
    would be of infinitesimal value to the ratepayers, this sum, in
    addition to the other charges, would prove a heavy burden on the
    funds of the Institution, if it did not altogether put an end to its
    future proceedings.—We are, Gentlemen, your obedient servants, Thos.
    Bull, Markham R. Evans, Hon. Secs.”

We find that the cost of lighting, warming, and cleansing the hall and
anterooms, and of warming and lighting the suite of rooms, will reach, on
a moderate estimate, £38 19s. (say £40) per annum, and we continue of
opinion that if the Vestry undertake these expenses, the Institution
should pay in addition, for the reasons above stated, £30 per annum as
rent.

We understand that an influential deputation will attend you this day
upon the subject.  We therefore, as the application is for the permanent
occupation of a portion of these premises, leave the ultimate decision of
the question respectfully in your hands.

Respectfully submitted,

BLAZDELL            W. NEWTON FINCH

MEMORIAL _re_ ADDITIONAL LOAN OF £2000.


_To the Honorable the Chairman and Members of the Metropolitan Board of
Works_.

The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the County of
Middlesex.

SHEWETH,

That the Parish of Chelsea is very extensive and populous.

That it comprises about 9000 houses, is nearly 800 acres in extent, and
contains a population of about 70,000 persons.

That the matters of public concern to so large a number of inhabitants
are necessarily very numerous and weighty.

That by the 92nd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, your
memorialists are authorized to defray expenses, as well for paving,
lighting, watering, cleansing, or improving the parish, as for those
public concerns; by the 150th section they are enabled to erect a
building for parish purposes; and by the 183rd section they are
permitted, with the sanction of your Honourable Board, to borrow any sums
of money necessary for defraying such expenses.

That with reference to the purposes for which a building so erected may
be used, Mr. Toulmin Smith is of opinion that “under these words, (public
concerns of any parish, or of the inhabitants thereof) it will become
matter of obligation on the Vestry in the case of a single parish, and on
the District Board in the case of parishes combined in a district, to
provide for the expenses of public meetings, and those other similar
matters touching ‘public concerns’ which are now done irregularly and
illegimately. * * * The words in the section are imperative,—these
expenses ‘shall be defrayed accordingly.’”  Again, “the most economical
course will always be to make such a building a part of the erection for
the offices, &c., of the board, as has already been done in the case of
St. Pancras Vestry Hall, and in some other cases in the Metropolis.”

That acting within the discretion thus vested in them your memoralists
have erected a Vestry Hall, which is suitable in every respect for the
purposes of your memorialists, and for the before-mentioned public
concerns of the inhabitants.

That as evidence that the large room was much required in this parish,
and is fully appreciated by the inhabitants, your memorialists do state
that since its opening on the 30th November last, seventy meetings of
various kinds have taken place therein, which may be thus
classified:—Religious and Moral, twenty-seven; Intellectual, twenty;
Social, Political, and to encourage the Volunteer movement, twenty-three.

That for nineteen of these meetings the use of the room has been given
absolutely without charge, and for the others a scale of payment has been
arranged by your Memorialists, which is in their opinion equitable and
fair—and which has been submitted to your Finance Committee.

That the building erected by your Memorialists is plain and substantial
in its character; the plan of it having been submitted to, and approved
by, your Honourable Board before it was commenced, (which original plan
has not been departed from in any substantial particular) and will cost
(excluding the cost of the site) the, not unreasonable, sum of Seven
Thousand pounds; being the original contract sum of £5630, and the
remainder for extra and additional works, which your Memorialists fear
are inevitable in all such undertakings.

That particulars in full detail of the estimated cost of the site,
building, fittings, furniture and sundries, have been laid before your
Finance Committee, by your Memorialists, amounting in the whole to about,
£12,000.

That your Memorialists are of opinion that the most equitable manner of
defraying the said expenses both for the present and future Ratepayers is
by means of a loan, repayable with interest in twenty years, thus
rendering the sanction of your Honorable Board requisite.

That the Large Hall is intended to be used for purposes of the Vestry,
and in fact is now about to be so used for the election of Vestrymen
under the Act.

That although a portion of the premises is now temporarily made use of as
Reading Rooms, as stated in the letter of your Memorialists to your
Finance Committee, those rooms will most probably be required for the Gas
Examiner under the Metropolis Gas Act, and the analyst under the Act for
the Prevention of the Adulteration of Food and Drink of last session.

That your Memorialists under the 150th Section of the Metropolis Local
Management Act deem the whole of the buildings necessary and expedient,
and under the 92nd section such buildings are fully authorized inasmuch
as they are clearly used for the public concerns of their Parish and the
inhabitants thereof.

That no further or additional rate, than was contemplated at the time the
original loan of £10,000, was sanctioned by your Honorable Board, will be
required.

That the following objects may be mentioned as showing the necessity of
the Vestry Hall:—A place of meeting for the local magistrates in petty
sessions; a place for the public discussion of important local public
questions, as the Embankment of the River at Chelsea, the Enfranchisement
of the District, the Removal of the Asylum Wall in the King’s Road, and
the Equalization of the Poor Rates.

That with reference to the remarks of your Finance Committee in their
report that their inquiries have satisfied them that the building has not
been erected exclusively for the purposes of the Vestry, but for other
objects not contemplated by the Metropolis Local Management Act, your
Memorialists submit that under the Act referred to, it is not
imperatively necessary that buildings of this description should be
erected exclusively for the purposes of the Vestry; and that the building
erected by your memorialists has not been erected for any object not
contemplated by the said Act.

Your Memorialists therefore pray that, as they, and the inhabitants of
the Parish represented by them, are of opinion that the expenses of the
said Vestry Hall, &c., are in relation to the regulation, government, or
public concerns of this Parish, and of the inhabitants thereof, and that
the sum of £12,000 is necessary for defraying such expenses; and that
such expenses will be best defrayed by a loan upon the credit of the
rates, your Honorable Board will not deem it expedient to refuse your
sanction to the additional loan of £2,000 already applied for.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, this 10th day of May,
1861

                                                   (Signed) CHARLES LAHEE,

Sir,—In connexion with the subjoined letter, I have been directed to
transmit for your consideration as a member of the Committee of Works and
for General Purposes, certain general heads for amendment.  Of the
meeting for the discussion of the same, and of any others which may
appear to you desirable, you will be specially advised.

                                              Metropolitan Board of Works,
                                 1, Greek Street, Soho, 9th January, 1858.

Dear Sir,—I beg to apprise you, for the information of the Vestry of
Chelsea, that the Metropolitan Board of Works are now engaged in
considering what amendments it may be expedient to introduce into the
Metropolis Local Management Act, in the present session of parliament,
and will be prepared to receive from the Vestry any suggestions they may
desire to offer in reference to those provisions of the Act which relate
to the duties and powers of vestries and district boards.  If the Vestry
should deem it proper to offer any suggestions, and you will be good
enough, at your early convenience, to transmit to me the draft of any
amended clause or clauses which may be proposed, I will immediately bring
the subject under the notice of this Board.

                                                           I am, dear Sir,
                                                    Yours very faithfully,
                                                           E. H. WOOLRYCH,
                                                       Clerk of the Board.

shall well and sufficiently pave    _Perhaps a power to vestries and

time to time keep such pavement
in good and sufficient repair;
and the owners of the houses
forming such street shall, on
demand, pay to such vestry or
board the amount of the estimated
expenses of providing and laying
such pavement, (such amount to be
determined by the surveyor for
the time being of the vestry or
board;) and in case such
estimated expenses exceed the
actual expenses of such paving,
then the difference between such
estimated expenses and such
actual expenses shall be repaid
by the said vestry or board to
the owners of houses by whom the
said sum of money has been paid;
and in case the said estimated
expenses be less than the actual
expenses of such paving, then the
owners of the said houses shall,
on demand, pay to the said vestry
or board such further sum of
money as, together with the sum
already paid, amounts to such
actual expenses.

CVI.  The vestry or district
board of any parish or district
may, if they think fit, by notice
in writing put up in any part of
any street in their parish or
district, not being a highway,
declare their intention of
repairing the same under this
Act, and thereupon the same shall
be from time to time repaired by
them under the authority of this
Act: Provided always, that no
street shall be repaired as last
aforesaid unless such notice in
writing be also given to all
persons interested in such
street, or if within one month
after notice in writing has been
put up or given as last aforesaid
any person interested in such
street, or the person
representing or entitled to
represent any person interested
as aforesaid, by notice in
writing to the vestry or board
object thereto.

CVIII.  It shall be lawful for
every vestry and district board
from time to time to place any
posts, fences, and rails on the
sides of any footways or
carriageways in their parish or
district, for the purposes of
safety, and to prevent any
carriage or cattle from going on
the same, and also to place any
posts or other erections in any
carriage-way so as to make the
crossings thereof less dangerous
for foot passengers, and also
from time to time to repair and
renew any such posts, rails or
fences, or to remove the same, or
any other obstruction or
encroachment on any carriageway
or footway.
CXIX.  If any porch, shed,          _To consider the propriety of

be an annoyance, in consequence
of the same projecting into or
being made in or endangering or
rendering less commodious the
passage along any street in their
parish or district, it shall be
lawful for the vestry or district
board to give notice in writing
to the owner or occupier of such
house or building to remove such
projection or obstruction, or to
alter the same, in such manner as
the vestry or board think fit,
&c.

board shall cause the several       following as the meaning of the

attorney or agent, at any time
within one month after service of
such notice, and in case the same

tender in bar, and (by leave of
the court) with the general issue
or other plea or pleas; and if
upon issue joined upon any plea
pleaded to the whole action the
jury find generally for the
defendant, or if the plaintiff be
nonsuited or discontinued, or if
the judgment be given for the
defendant, then the defendant
shall be entitled to full costs
of suit and have judgment

defendant, by leave of the court,
at any time before trial, to pay
into court under plea such sum of
money as he may think proper, and
(by the like leave) to plead the
general issue or other plea or
pleas, any rule of court or
practice to the contrary
notwithstanding.

                                                      December 29th, 1859.

Dear Sir,—I am directed by the Vestry of this parish to request that,
when your Board shall apply to Parliament for the further Amendment of
the Metropolis Local Management Act, a clause may be introduced, enacting
that so much of the provisions of the 67th and 68th sections of the 57th
George the III., cap. 29, being “An Act for better paving, improving, and
regulating the streets of the Metropolis, and removing and preventing
Nuisances and Obstructions therein,” as relates to the nuisance arising
from hog styes, and to the breeding, feeding, and keeping of swine, and
suffering them to stray, be extended to the following parishes and places
within the Metropolis, which were not, at the time of the passing of the
said Act, included in the Weekly Bills of Mortality: that is to
say,—Paddington; Camberwell; Chelsea; St. Mary Abbot, Kensington;
Woolwich; St. John, Hampstead; St. Paul, Deptford, including Hatcham; St.
Nicholas, Deptford; Greenwich; Clapham; Tooting Graveney; Streatham; St.
Mary, Battersea, excluding Penge; Wandsworth; Putney; including
Roehampton; St. Mary, Stoke Newington; St. Peter and St. Paul,
Hammersmith; Fulham; St. Mary, Stratford-le-Bow; and St. Leonard,
Bromley: also enacting that the penalties imposed by these sections may
be recovered in the manner provided by the 227th section of the Act for
the better Local Management of the Metropolis, 18th and 19th Vict., cap.
120.

                                         I have the honor to be, dear Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

J. Pollard, Esq.,
Metropolitan Board of Works,

                                                      December 29th, 1859.

Dear Sir,—I am directed by this Vestry to request that when your Board
shall apply to Parliament for the further Amendment of the Metropolis
Local Management Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120, the 85th section of that
Act may be altered by the insertion after the first word “works” of words
to the following effect: viz.:—

    “And in the case of combined drainage such notice may require that
    each house of any block of houses drained in combination, or so many
    thereof as the Vestry or Board shall see fit, shall be drained
    separately into a sewer.”

                                         I have the honor to be, dear Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

J. Pollard, Esq.,
Metropolitan Board of Works,
1, Greek Street, Soho.



                                                       January 23rd, 1860.

Dear Sir,—The Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health have
brought under the consideration of this Vestry the desirability of
extending to the cow houses within the Metropolis, the system of annual
licenses, as it prevails with regard to slaughter houses, and they have
directed me to acquaint you, for the information of the Metropolitan
Board of Works, that if a proposal is made to provide for such an
extension of the law, in their forthcoming amendment Bill, this Vestry,
upon the recommendation of their Medical Officer of Health, will give
such proposal their cordial support.

I beg to send you a copy of the Report of Dr. Barclay, our Medical
Officer of Health, above alluded to.

                                         I have the honor to be, dear Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

J. Pollard, Esq.,
1, Greek Street, Soho.



 _Extract from the Report of the Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry
                        of the Parish of Chelsea_.

                                                      22nd November, 1859.

At your last meeting I was requested to report upon a suggestion made to
this Vestry by the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of
Health, to the effect that you should unite with other vestries in the
endeavour “to procure insertion in the proposed bill for amending the
Metropolis Local Management Act, of a clause relating to the annual
licensing of Cow Houses.”  I was also requested to consider the propriety
of extending the system of licensing to the keeping of pigs.

With reference to these two questions, I have to observe, that the
grounds upon which such a proposition rests are mainly two; viz.:, the
_necessity for_ such a business being carried on where it now is, and the
probability that such a business may, if carelessly conducted, be a
nuisance to the neighbourhood.  For by the very fact of the license being
granted, the option of endeavouring to remove the cause of nuisance
altogether is entirely given up.  This authority is accorded to the
magistrate, by the Nuisances Removal Act, but is very rarely exercised in
cases brought before the Metropolitan Police Courts, because it has
generally been held that its powers were not intended to be used for the
suppression, but only for the regulation of offensive trades.

In regard to the keeping of cows throughout the Metropolis, a necessity
exists from which, under present circumstances, we cannot escape,
because, in hot weather, neither milk nor cream can be brought from a
distance in a perfectly sweet and fresh state, and at no time of year can
good cream be obtained from milk (as I am informed) after a journey.  At
the same time, cow houses badly kept in a town are liable to become a
nuisance, 1st by effluvia from the building itself; 2nd, by accumulations
of dung, and annoyances during their removal, of which we have had
several examples in this parish; 3rd, by injury to the health of the
cows, which will consequently yield a supply of unhealthy milk, or may
become the means of diseased meat being sold at the inferior butchers’
stalls.  Under such circumstances, it seems not unreasonable that the
vestry should seek by conceding the necessity for their permanence and
granting a license, to place them more completely under the control of
their officers.



          _Letter from W. Tite_, _Esq._, _to the Vestry Clerk_.

My dear Sir,



Mr. Woolrych asks me whether the vestry can suggest a clause to meet the
case of combined drainage when it has appeared to become public drainage
by the ill advised arrangements of the late Commissioners?

This was the point on which I saw him some months since, and if the
vestry wish it, I will try what is to be done; you had better perhaps
give me a call any morning you please.

                                                              Yours truly,
                                                             WILLIAM TITE.



             _From the Vestry Clerk to W. Tite_, _Esq. M.P._

                               PIPE SEWERS.

                                                       January 14th, 1860.

Sir,—Not being a lawyer I speak with great diffidence on the subject of
your note of the 7th, but it appears to me that if an alteration were
made in the interpretation clause of the Local Management Act, as to the
meaning of the word “drain,” it would accomplish what we wish.

It now runs thus, “the word ‘drain’ shall mean and include any drain of
and used for the drainage of one building only, or premises within the
same curtilage, and made merely for the purpose of communicating with a
cesspool or other like receptacle for drainage, or with a sewer into
which the drainage of two or more buildings or premises, occupied by
different persons, is conveyed, _and shall also include any drain for
draining any group or block of houses by a combined operation_, _under
the order of any vestry or district board_.”  I would suggest that the
following words be added “or under the order, sanction, or direction of
any Commissioners of Sewers, acting within the metropolis previous to the
passing of the Act for the better Local Management of the metropolis, 18
and 19 Vic. Cap. 120.”

                            COMBINED DRAINAGE.
                           PIG STY REGULATIONS.

These two matters formed the subjects of my communication to Mr. Pollard,
of the 29th ultimo, and copies of them were on the same day sent to you.
They both have reference to the amendment of the Act, and were
recommended to the vestry by Dr. Barclay, the Medical Officer of Health.

                                                                I am, Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

William Tite, Esq., M.P. &c. &c.

                  _The Vestry Clerk to the Solicitors_.

                                                            May 2nd, 1860.

             METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT AMENDMENT BILL.

Dear Sirs,—You may have observed that Mr. Tite introduced this Bill into
the House of Commons on Monday evening, consequently no time must be lost
in seeing him with reference to the following matters.

It is unfortunate that the Bill accompanying your letter of the 24th
ultimo was not the last reprint: however, I beg to send you a copy of the
last reprint, which you will observe differs in some particulars, and as
to the numbers of the clauses, from the former one.

With reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, and the Bill
accompanying it, they were referred by the Vestry on that day to the
Committee of Works, and they met yesterday to consider them.

I beg to send you an extract from the Minutes with reference to them.

                                                          I am, dear Sirs,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

Messrs. Lee and Pemberton,
44, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, W.C.



 _Extract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Committee of Works and for
  General Purposes_, _held in the Board Room_, _Manor House_, _Tuesday_,
                            _May_ 1_st_, 1860,

The Committee considered the letter of the Solicitors (Messrs. Lee and
Pemberton), dated 24th of April, respecting the Bill for the Amendment of
the Metropolis Local Management Act.  The Clerk laid upon the table 12
copies of the last reprint of the Bill, and reported that the Bill had
been introduced the previous evening in the House of Commons by Mr. Tite,
M.P.

Resolved,—That this Committee _do not_ concur with the Solicitors in
their remarks upon the Bill accompanying their letter respecting the
following five clauses:—

CLAUSE 11, enacting that any Vestry or District Board may pay the
precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works out of any money in their
possession, and reimburse themselves out of the Sewers Rate.  _Remark
referred to_:—‘We think this clause very objectionable; it appears to
involve a breach of trust on the part of the Vestry.  Funds raised for
one purpose should not be applied to another; and the effect is to give
the Metropolitan Board of Works a first charge on every Rate collected.
What does the Poor Law Board say to it?’

CLAUSE 13, enacting that if any Vestry, &c., neglect to pay the money
required by the precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, that Board
may make a rate on default, without awaiting the expiration of the period
fixed by the precept.  _Remark referred to_:—‘Two months is not enough,
it should at least be four.’

CLAUSE 41, relating to the case of a Vestryman—a member of a District
Board—not attending meetings for six months.  _Remark referred to_:—‘Or
committee thereof.  We think this inexpedient.  The member should go out
as if by rotation, and be ineligible for the vacancy so created.’

CLAUSE 60, relative to contributions to the cost of main sewers and
sewers built since January 1st, 1856, or hereafter to be built.  _Remark
referred to_:—‘Leave out these words (lines 32 and 33, ‘at their
discretion’).’

CLAUSE 62, prescribing the regulations to be observed in making openings
into sewers.  _Remark referred to_:—‘We think this clause is better out,
unless it is made to go further.  The Vestry should have power to alter
old drains.’

_Resolved_,—That if in the opinion of the Solicitors further powers are
requisite than are contained in the above clause, they be authorized to
prepare such a clause.

_Resolved_,—That this Committee _do_ concur with the solicitors in their
remarks respecting the following ten clauses, and authorize them to
prepare clauses to give effect to their recommendations.

CLAUSE 22, relative to the recovery of moneys assessed by the
Metropolitan Board of Works on extra parochial property for payment of
debts.  _Remark referred to_—‘Instead of ‘a justice’ should be ‘two
justices or a police magistrate,’ the same error occurs in other parts of
the Bill.’

CLAUSE 42, providing that owners and occupiers of land may execute
drainage works at their own expense.  _Remark referred to_:—‘We think the
sewer when built should vest in the Vestry.  It should be built under the
superintendence of their Surveyor; and the party applying should find
sureties for the performance of the work, under penalties, to be
recoverable as liquidated damages.’

_Resolved_,—That in the opinion of this Committee the words in line 21
‘hereinafter mentioned’ should stand, with the interlineation ‘_or_ that
any Vestry may think proper to attach.’

CLAUSE 48, prescribing the regulations to be observed on abandonment,
alteration, &c., of designs for sewers previously approved by the
Metropolitan Board of Works.  _Remark referred to_:—‘And in case they do
there should be a heavy penalty recoverable by action.’

CLAUSE 66, empowering Vestries, &c., on neglect of owners, &c., to carry
out works, pursuant to orders, to proceed for the penalties, or do the
works themselves, and recover the cost.  _Remark referred to_:—‘Line 27
erase ‘person or persons,’ insert ‘such owner or occupier.’  Line 37
insert ‘or occupier.’

CLAUSE 67, extending penalties to persons causing offences.  _Remark
referred to_:—‘And all penalties recoverable under this Act.’

CLAUSE 69, empowering Vestries, &c., to compel supply of water to houses.
_Remark referred to_:—‘We do not think this clause will work, unless a
power be invested for making the expense a first charge; it will be
nugatory and will cause useless expense.

CLAUSE 74, empowering Vestries, &c., with sanction of the Metropolitan
Board of Works, to effect improvements within their districts, &c.
_Remark referred to_:—‘We think this clause requires remodelling.  It
does not go far enough.  We think the clauses for improving streets in
the Towns improvement Clauses Act should be embodied in this Act,
particularly sec. 67; and also the clauses of the Lands Clauses
Consolidation Act, enabling the Vestry to take compulsory possession of
land.’

CLAUSE 75, enacting that buildings projecting beyond the general line of
the street, where taken down to an extent exceeding one half, shall be
set back to the general line.  _Remark referred to_:—‘This should be
extended to Vestries with the consent of the Metropolitan Board of
Works.’

CLAUSE 78, empowering Vestries &c. to drain and pave courts, &c. on
default of owners, in lieu of enforcing penalties.  _Remark referred
to_:—‘The judgment when recovered should be a first charge on the
property, with power of sale in default of payment, on three month’s
notice affixed on the premises.’

CLAUSE 93, enacting that a Vestry or District Board may require payment
of costs or expenses from an owner or occupier, and the occupier paying
to deduct from rent.  _Remark referred to_:—‘We do not think the clause
goes far enough.  The Vestry to be properly protected against their
enormous outlay, should have a statutable charge upon the premises for
moneys expended by them recovered by judgment.  We see no reason why the
Vestry should not have a power of sale something similar to that given to
the Commissioners of Police under the 74th section of the Metropolitan
Buildings Act, 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 122; unless this is effectually done,
the annual loss to every parish which carries out the intentions of the
Metropolis Local Management Act, must be considerable; the Act will
become a dead letter, or Vestries must be protected from loss.’

_Resolved_,—That the attention of the Solicitors be directed to the
discrepancy between the marginal note to Clause 52, and the body of the
clause.

_Resolved_,—That the Solicitors do endeavour to obtain the following
alterations:—Clause 90 in the Bill above referred to, line 29, omit the
words, ‘which may be unfit for the keeping of swine, or where the
breeding, feeding, or keeping swine may create a nuisance or be injurious
to health,’ in order to insert the words, ‘within forty yards of any
street.’

Line 31, insert after the word ‘place’ the words, ‘or in any locality,
premises, or place in such manner as to be a nuisance to other persons
residing near thereto.’

_Resolved_,—That the Solicitors and the Vestry Clerk be instructed to
arrange with Mr. Tite as to the best mode of obtaining the above
alterations in the Bill now before Parliament.



              _The Vestry Clerk to W. Tite_, _Esq._, _M.P._

                                                         April 25th, 1861.

             METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT AMENDMENT BILL.

Sir,

I am directed to send you copy of a Petition of this Vestry to the House
of Commons respecting your Bills (Nos. 1 & 2) for Amending the Metropolis
Local Management Act, which Lord Enfield has been requested to present.

I am also to send you the four new clauses and amendments which are
referred to in the prayer of the Petition, and to request that you will
obtain the introduction of them into the Bill No. 1.

                                              I have the honor to be, Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

W. Tite, Esq., M.P., &c., &c.,
42, Lowndes Square.



_To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
                    Ireland in Parliament assembled_.

The Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, in the
County of Middlesex,

SHEWETH,

That Your Petitioners are informed and believe that two Bills, intituled
respectively “The Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment Bills, Nos. 1
& 2,” are now before your Honourable House, by the first of which relief
is proposed to be given to the late Counter’s Creek separate sewerage
district in this parish, for certain sums expended in respect of the
Counters Creek Diversion Works, and improperly charged upon the said
district in respect of the construction of sewers and works for the
general benefit of the Metropolis; and by the other it is intended to
settle upon equitable principles the parishes, districts, and parts, upon
which certain debts of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers shall
stand charged, having regard to the benefit derived by those parishes,
&c., respectively from such expenditure.

That under the Act for the Better Local Management of the Metropolis, 18
& 19 Vic., cap. 120, the Metropolitan Board of Works found themselves
unable, from the defective powers of the said Act, to give any relief to
the said Counters Creek District from payment of the charges upon it
above mentioned, and in consequence thereof a great amount of
dissatisfaction has existed in this and other districts similarly
circumstanced.

That in consequence of such and other defects in the practical working of
the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestries and District Boards
constituted under the said Act have instigated the Metropolitan Board to
introduce the said Bills to your Honourable House to remedy the same, and
for other purposes.

That your Petitioners being by the said Metropolis Local Management Act
constituted the authority to order the levying of the rates under the
said Act, have incurred a considerable amount of unpopularity and censure
in performing a duty which is against their own consciences, and
repulsive to the feelings of the ratepayers residing in that district.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House that the
said Bill, with certain amendments and new clauses which your Petitioners
propose to endeavour to effect the introduction of, when in Committee may
pass into law.

And your Petitioners will ever pray.

                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, this 23rd day of April,
1861.



                         _The Four New Clauses_.

1.—In Clause 46, line four, for the words “twenty-six” substitute the
word “thirteen;” add a clause after said clause as follows:—“If any
member of the Metropolitan Board of Works shall be absent from the
meetings of the said Board for thirteen consecutive weeks, he shall
thereupon cease to be a member of the said Board; and the said
Metropolitan Board of Works shall immediately send notice of the fact to
the Vestry or District Board by which such member was elected, whereupon
which Vestry or District Board shall forthwith proceed to elect a new
member for the said Metropolitan Board in the room of the member so
ceasing to be a member as aforesaid; and such election shall be conducted
in accordance with the 44th, 45th, and 46th sections of the
firstly-recited Act, so far as the same are respectively applicable.”

2.—Provided always that in construing the 6th section of the
firstly-recited Act, in calculating the number of Poor Rate assessments
in any parish, each house, or piece or parcel of land, tenement, or
hereditament rated to the relief of the poor, shall be counted and taken
as a separate Poor Rate assessment.

3.—Notwithstanding anything in the said recited Acts or this Act to the
contrary, Be it enacted, that the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the
County of Middlesex, shall from time to time raise and levy the sums
which they may require for defraying the expenses of executing the said
Acts and this Act, and shall for that purpose make separate equal pound
rates upon their parish or part thereof, in like manner as overseers are
required to do with respect to the sums for which orders are by the
firstly-recited Act directed to be made upon them by Vestries and
District Boards; and shall in raising such sums act upon the like
principles, and have the like discretion, as provided in the
firstly-recited Act with respect to orders upon Overseers by Vestries and
District Boards, subject to the provisions of this Act, and shall for
that purpose have free access to, and be at liberty to copy or adopt any
assessment to the Poor Rate in the said parish, or any part or parts of
such assessment; and such Vestry shall have power to appoint a collector
or collectors for levying the amount of such rates, and to pay him or
them such salary, poundage, or allowance as they may deem just and
reasonable; and shall take such security from every such collector for
the due execution of his duty as they shall think reasonable and proper;
and such collector or collectors shall proceed in the same manner, and
shall have the same powers and remedies, and be subject to the same
regulations and directions with reference to the levying of such rates,
as if he or they were an overseer or overseers of the poor, and shall pay
over the amount of such rates to the said Vestry or otherwise, as such
Vestry may direct; and such collector or collectors shall, when and in
such manner as shall be required by the said Vestry, make out and deliver
a true and perfect account in writing, signed by him or them, of all
monies received by him or them, in manner provided by the 65th section of
the firstly-recited Act; and in default of his or their so paying over
such moneys, or making out and delivering such account in writing, he or
they shall be subject to the penalties mentioned and contained in the
said 65th section of the firstly-recited Act in the case of officers or
servants failing to account for moneys received; and it shall be lawful
for the said Vestry by order in writing, to require the Clerk to the
Guardians of the Poor of the said parish or other person having the
custody or control of any rate for the relief of the poor in such parish,
or of any other rate or of any book containing a copy of any such rate as
aforesaid, to furnish within such period, not being less than seven days,
as shall be limited in such order, a true copy of such rate for the
relief of the poor, or other rate or of such copy thereof, as aforesaid,
or of such part or parts of the same as shall be specified in such order,
on payment or tender for such copy at the rate of sixpence for every
twenty-four names (inclusive of all the particulars in the several
columns in the rate, so far as such particulars have reference to such
names respectively), and the said copy shall be examined by and signed by
such Clerk, or other person, and shall be verified by his solemn
declaration, if the said Vestry shall require the same, which solemn
declaration any Justice of the Peace or Commissioner duly authorized is
hereby empowered to administer, and any person having the custody or
control of such rate, or copy thereof, who shall refuse or neglect to
make and deliver to such Vestry or any person by them authorised to
receive the same, such copy or extract, or to make such solemn
declaration as aforesaid, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10
for every such offence, and to a further penalty of £10 for each and
every day during which the said offence shall be continued, to be
recovered by a summary proceeding.

4.—That in place of the 109th Clause, the following be inserted:—“The two
hundred and thirty-fourth section of the firstly-recited Act is hereby
repealed, and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that all penalties or
forfeitures payable or recoverable under the firstly-recited Act, or this
Act, and all penalties or forfeitures recovered by any Vestry or District
Board acting as the local authority for the execution within their
respective parish or district of ‘The Nuisances Removal Act for England,
1855,’ shall go and be paid in manner hereinafter mentioned, anything
contained in an Act made and passed in the session holden in the Second
and Third years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter seventy-one,
or in any other Act or Acts to the contrary notwithstanding;—that is to
say, shall go to the Vestry or District Board of the parish or district
in which the offence was committed, or to the Metropolitan Board of Works
in case the injury shall have been sustained by, or the offence committed
in respect of that Board; and all sums which shall go to or be recovered
by any Board or Vestry on account of any penalty or forfeiture, shall be
paid to their treasurer, or into such bank to their account as they may
direct, and shall be applicable towards the general expenses of such
Board or Vestry.”




APPENDIX No. 20.
CHELSEA CHARITIES.


_The Articles in the_ West Middlesex Advertiser _referred to in Mr.
Druce’s letter at page_ 20, _in the Report_.

                                                            April 7, 1860.

The peculiar position in which the parish of St. Luke’s, Chelsea, at the
present moment stands, induces every one interested to prevent by every
possible means the occurrence of future discord arising from what may in
after years be difficult to correct.  Probably for many years, no period
has ever existed in which the parish of Chelsea has been more dependent
on the wise action of its patrons, property holders, and inhabitants in
general than at the present moment.  Circumstances having afforded us
opportunities of acquiring much knowledge of its affairs generally, and
deeming that the kindest act would be to communicate some portions of
that knowledge to our fellow-parishioners, we venture to intrude the
following matters on their attention.  Our readers are aware of the
movement made with reference to the assessments, but they may also know
from personal experience, the great difficulty of the question, and from
having been for some years, careful observers of the actions of many of
those gentleman who bestow so much of their time and ability on parochial
affairs, we are thoroughly convinced, that such matters are carefully and
honestly administered; and although the watchful check of the ratepayers
and other Societies is very beneficial, we doubt whether much good would
arise from any material change.  The attention of the Vestry, and the
separation to some extent of church matters from the general interests of
the parish, has deprived its officers of the advantage of a “legal vestry
clerk,” and thus the local authorities in whom are vested many of its
charities have lost their best and proper adviser, and many of the
charity interests are not in such a state as they should be in a
well-ordered parish; for instance, the sums of money belonging to the St.
Luke’s, Chelsea, parochial school stand thus—

£764 13s. 4d., the gift of Earl Cadogan, stands in the name of Lee
Jortin, Esq., and others, some of whom have passed away, and Mr. Jortin,
is not so strong in health as his friends would wish him.

£692 2s. 4d., the gift of Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Bryan, stands in the name of
the Rev. Chas. Kingsley and Philip Burrard, both dead.

£100 the gift of Mr. P. Burrard, stands in the name of the Rev. C.
Kingsley and Mr. Walker, both dead.

£450 the gift of Mrs. MacPherson,

£445 14s. 7d., the gift of Charles Walker, Esq., stand in the name of the
Rev. Charles Kingsley and Mr. W. Druce.  Thus supposing the first to be
in safe trust, the two next are without any trustees, and the two last,
in the name of one individual, which is not as it should be.

Again, Chamberlain’s Charity is for educating boys in the parochial
school, and then apprenticing them; the Vestry elects the boys, and the
parochial officers ought to do the rest, but the money is placed in the
Savings’ Bank, and there we suppose it rests; there is a sum of money
also lying at the parish bankers to the credit of the Chelsea charities,
which we much suspect belongs to this charity, this sum has been lying
unused for many years: it is also the duty of the parochial officers to
see that the money paid for the benefit of the school children under Mr.
Flood’s gift is properly applied: the treasurer of the schools cannot be
expected to apprentice the children, so this money also finds its way
into the Savings’ Bank.  It is in these cases that the loss of the legal
Vestry Clerk is felt, as from the nature of the present Vestry, and the
limitation as to powers of interference with church matters, renders the
assistance of the able Clerk of the Vestry, as now constituted, of no
avail.  The question also of the Church Trustees is in a very peculiar
state; there is great uncertainty as to their powers.  A most careful
examination of the conflicting clauses of the Act creates great doubt as
to whether the power of the Trustees to make a rate does actually expire
at the present period, as is generally believed.  If their powers of
rating do expire, they will find themselves with an important trust to
carry out without the means of performing their trust.  We think it would
tend much to the well-being of the parish generally if the Vestry, on
Easter Tuesday, were to appoint a committee to inquire and report on the
course it may be desirable to pursue with respect to the Church Trust.
It must be the wish of everyone that the power to rate should cease
absolutely, and that we should never again hear of a church rate in the
parish of Chelsea.  Possibly a short Act of Parliament, annulling the
present Board of Trustees, and putting an end to the Act, would be the
best mode of proceeding; thus leaving the Rector and Incumbent of the
churches and the Church Officers to take charge of their own interests,
taking the revenue of the church and making the best of it; the removal
of the expense of the Board of Trustees, and a moderate contribution of
the congregations towards the expense of what may be called church
luxuries would meet the necessity of the case.  Without great care and
consideration this matter may become a troublesome and annoying parochial
question.  The old Rector has passed away, a new one has been appointed;
let us not forget that, amidst the doctrinal disquisition and rubrical
eccentricities of which we have heard so much, we have enjoyed, under the
former, a quarter of a century of religious peace, and let us hope that
the wise actions of the new one may tend to increase the affectionate
feeling so many of us hold for the memory of his father and grandfather.

                      _Saturday_, _April_ 14, 1860.

Though the name of Mr. LOVELAND is always spoken of with the greatest
respect as the former vestry clerk of this parish, yet we by no means
wish to infer the necessity of a legal gentleman filling that office.  We
believe that it could not be in better hands than it is, and we have felt
it to be our duty, on more occasions than one, to express our warm
approbation of the conduct of Mr. LAHEE.  Litigation will arise in every
parish, and may be promoted to a very great extent by the appointment of
attorneys, and even if it were not so they would get the credit and the
obloquy, and therefore should not be placed in so unenviable a position.

Mr. Toulmin Smith says, ‘It may be safely stated, that it will be usually
the wisest course not to appoint a person of the legal profession to the
office of vestry clerk.  It is quite unnecessary to the discharge of any
of his duties that he should be of that profession; while his being so
has a tendency to encourage a narrow technical mode of dealing with the
duties of the parish, and very often indeed lead to litigation, for which
there is no real occasion whatever.

‘Every parish should, however, have some known and confidential
professional man of the neighbourhood, to whom it should refer on
occasions needing professional action or advice.’

Again, in Brady and Mahon’s work on Parochial Law and Taxation it is
said, ‘A custom has prevailed of late years of appointing attorneys as
vestry clerks.  The numberless statutes by which parochial affairs are
now regulated, give something like a satisfaction to this practice, and
the conflicting decision of the courts of law on parish cases, would lead
to a belief that none but a lawyer could be qualified for the office.
But whatever may be the cause, the fact appears to be unquestionable that
such appointments have tended greatly to the increase of parochial
expenditure; for the professional gentlemen thus selected as vestry
clerks, however unjust it may be to attribute to them obliquity, foul
play or evil designs very naturally carry with them into office a sort of
_esprit du corps_ which leads to appeals to quarter sessions, vexatious
removals, litigious contests, journies half over the kingdom, the
inevitable consequence of which is an enormous annual expenditure,
amounting, it is said, to something like one third of the total poor
rates!’

With such statements as these emanating from lawyers it would be absurd
to argue for the continuance of a practice fraught with such imminent
danger to the pockets of the parishioners.




APPENDIX No. 21.
CREMORNE GARDENS.


       _Report of the Committee of Works and for General Purposes_.

                            Board Room, Manor House, September 24th, 1860.

                 To the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea.

Gentlemen,—We, the undersigned, of your Committee of Works and for
General Purposes, beg to present the following special report upon the
resolution passed by you on the 11th instant (25):—

    “That the Committee of Works be requested to consider the whole
    question relating to Cremorne Gardens as to past proceedings, present
    injury and annoyance to the parishioners, and the probable increase
    of such damage and nuisance in consequence of the proposed change
    from one proprietor to a company; to report thereon, and the course
    they would recommend to be adopted to mitigate, and, if necessary,
    put an end to the evil.”

With reference to the first portion of the enquiry we have had laid
before us, the whole record of your former proceedings, with the evidence
taken before the licensing magistrates in 1857, which we have attentively
considered; and we are of opinion that the second report presented by the
Committee at that time contains much that is valuable, and only requires
to obtain due publicity to have a great effect in diminution of the evils
to which it adverts—evils which the unfavourable weather during the past
season has prevented from becoming so intolerable as during the seasons
of 1858 and 1859, but which the return of a hot summer, and the intended
change from the direct responsibility attaching to one proprietorship to
the infinitesimally reduced responsibility of the individual shareholders
in a public company would, in the opinion of your Committee, largely
increase.

Nor, it is to be feared, would these evils be confined as heretofore to
the summer months, for the prospectus of the new company offers the bait
to shareholders that the gardens may be made profitable during the winter
also.

Having regard therefore to the magnitude of the question with which we
have to deal, and the advice of a sub-committee appointed by us to
consult the solicitors as to the course to be pursued, we recommend that
the report before alluded to, be printed and circulated, and that a
petition be presented forthwith to the licensing magistrates, praying
that the hour of closing Cremorne Gardens may be made twelve o’clock at
night, as has been the case with other public gardens, and that the
solicitors be instructed to take all necessary steps in that behalf.

Respectfully submitted,

                                                       WM. HALL, Chairman.
                                                          W. NEWTON FINCH.
                                                          ALEXR. BLAZDELL.
                                                              W. LAWRENCE.
                                                              WILLIAM FOY.
                                                           J. COWAN BREUN.
                                                             HENRY OXFORD.
                                                               WM. SANSUM.




APPENDIX No. 22.


  _Report of a Committee appointed to investigate the State of the Town
           Meadows called_ “_The Lotts_,” _April_ 18_th_, 1834.

    “We have seen the land, and behold it is very good.”—Judges xviii. 9.

Mr. Chairman,—Agreeably to the Resolution passed at the last Board
relative to the appointment of a Committee to go and view the meadow-land
called “the Lotts,” I have now to inform you, Sir, and the Committee at
large, that we proceeded thither on Friday morning, and upon arrival, we
found the gates locked up; we, however, procured the key of the adjoining
lands which communicate with “the Lotts,” of a woman who lives in the
late Mr. Brown’s cottage.

After proceeding to the western extremity of the meadow, we found that a
large bank had been thrown up at the time of the cutting of the canal,
and that by this means perhaps one fourth part of the land had been lost,
or taken away to widen the canal; but we were of opinion that this bank
might be gradually levelled and sloped down on the meadow below, so as to
elevate it, and render it free from inundation, and thus make it more fit
for any kind of cultivation or pasture.  And we were all moreover
unanimously of opinion, that it would be highly desirable to obtain
re-possession of this valuable piece of land for the use of the
parishioners.

No determination, however, as to the means by which this most desirable
object could be effected was formed on this occasion, and I am humbly of
opinion that the Committee must continue their earnest endeavours, in
order to obtain all possible evidence upon this difficult and complicated
case.  It seems proper to observe, in this stage of the business, that
“the Lotts” are Lammas Land, and have been for ages appurtenant to the
Manor of Chelsea.  The Lord of the Manor possesses the right of letting
the land on lease, for the Spring and Summer quarters, beginning with
March and ending in August; and the inhabitants at large enjoy the
privilege of turning in their cattle from August till February, being the
Autumn and Winter quarters.  This state of appropriation continued till
the year 1825 or 1826, when the Directors of the Kensington Canal Company
took unlawful possession of them for their own use, immediately upon the
completion of their Canal; and they have illegally detained them ever
since, and have let them successively to several persons, and received
rent for the same.  It now, therefore, becomes a question, by what
authority they have shut out the ancient inhabitants, landowners, and
householders from their undoubted privilege of turning in their cattle to
graze, a privilege which they have uninterruptedly enjoyed for a
succession of ages, and which they are confident has never been on their
part either invalidated or annulled.

It must not, however, be concealed on this occasion, that it has been
confidently reported from many quarters that money was offered to the
parishioners for the surrender of their rights to these lands, by the
Directors of the Canal Company; and that money was accepted by the
Churchwardens of that time; for their Act of Parliament specially
declares that the Churchwardens, Overseers, and four Freeholders
appointed in Vestry, only shall receive and be accountable for all monies
paid for land under this act.

But after the most diligent enquiry relative to any money transactions,
or to the execution of any bond, or deed, or lease, or assignment, we
have the affirmation in writing of one of the then Churchwardens, denying
the receipt of any money, or compensation whatever; and as this
Churchwarden is a man of probity, we are, of course, bound to place every
degree of confidence in his averment.  It is also necessary to mention,
that the Directors of the Kensington Canal Company have become bankrupt
since the completion of the Canal, and that any legal proceedings on our
part to endeavour to obtain any money from them, either as compensation
for damages done to the lands, or for rent, would only involve the parish
in useless expense.

Your Committee, therefore, after a most careful and diligent
investigation, are of opinion that it would be prudent to wait patiently
until the twelfth day of August next, and on that day those inhabitants
who have been accustomed to turn in their cattle to graze, should proceed
thither with some horses and cows, preceded by the Parish Beadle, Rector,
Churchwardens, Overseers, and such Members of the Parochial Committee,
and other inhabitants, as may think proper, and if upon their arrival
they find the gates locked up, they be ordered to break them open, and
turn in their cattle as they have been accustomed to do from time
immemorial.

In conclusion, permit me to apologize to you, Sir, for the length of this
Report, and humbly to hope that the extreme importance of the case
affecting the ancient and undoubted privileges of the inhabitants of this
Parish will form a sufficient apology; and finally, permit me to hope,
Sir, that you and every other Member of this Committee will cordially and
zealously assist me in my earnest endeavours to obtain the re-possession
of these lands.

_Resolved_, unanimously, that the thanks of the Committee be given to Mr.
Faulkner for his able Report, and that it be entered in the Minute Book,
and printed and circulated throughout the Parish.

                                                 J. W. LOCKWOOD, Chairman.

APPENDIX No. 23.
CHELSEA HOSPITAL GROUNDS.


 _To the Right Honourable William Cowper_, _M.P._, _Chief Commissioner of
                Her Majesty’s Works and Public Buildings_.

  The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the County of
                                Middlesex,

SHEWETH,

That your Memorialists are sensible of, and grateful for, the benefit
which has resulted to their parish and to the public from the
improvements which have of late years been made in the grounds of the
Royal Hospital, and from their having been thrown open for the recreation
and resort of the crowded neighbouring population.

That by the present regulations, the grounds are closed during the months
of May, June, July, and August, at eight o’clock in the evening.

That an extension of the time of closing the gardens, particularly on
Sunday evenings, would, in the opinion of your Memorialists, be much
esteemed by their frequenters; and as evidence that this would be so, a
correspondent of your Memorialists writes: “An extension of the time of
closing the Royal Hospital Grounds to the same hours as Battersea Park,
would be accepted as a great boon by all classes, more especially on the
Sunday evenings in the hot weather, as, though the grounds are opened on
Sundays at two o’clock in the afternoon, they are not generally much
attended till after tea, which makes it half-past six o’clock, or even
seven, before the mass of visitors arrive (according to the distance they
have to come, as many come from London by the steamboats), and at a
quarter to eight o’clock in the very height of summer, they begin to
clear the grounds, and at eight o’clock precisely they are finally
closed.

It is naturally felt to be a great hardship to be so turned out when the
sun is shining brightly on a warm summer evening, and when, though
comparatively early, still too late to go anywhere else (except
Cremorne), and the consequences may at once be seen by the fact of the
public houses and beer shops in the neighbourhood being immediately
filled, a state of things much to be deplored.

Persons attending a place of worship are of course quite precluded from
taking a walk round the grounds when they come out, and before they go
home, the grounds being closed so early.

The comforts and rest of the inmates of the Royal Hospital need not be
interfered with, as the public could be shut off the central part at a
certain hour, if thought desirable, and all might leave the grounds by
the eastern and western entrances; and if the additional hour’s duty be
thought too much for the pensioners, three or four policemen additional,
or other attendants, could be provided at a very small additional
expense.

Your Memorialists therefore respectfully request that you will consider
the foregoing, and give directions that the regulations for closing the
said grounds may be assimilated to those of Battersea Park.

And your Memorialists will ever pray.

Sir,

I am directed by the First Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c., to
acquaint you, for the information of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea,
that he has given instructions for the closing of Chelsea Hospital
Grounds at the same hours as the gates in Battersea Park, as requested in
their Memorial which accompanied your letter to this Board, dated the 2nd
instant, upon the understanding that some slight modification of the rule
may be adopted if any practical inconvenience to the authorities of the
Hospital should be found to result from the proposed alteration.

                                                                I am, Sir,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                            ALFRED AUSTIN,
                                                                Secretary.

APPENDIX No. 24.
THAMES EMBANKMENT.


  _To the Right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament
                               assembled_.

The Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea in the County of
Middlesex,

SHEWETH,

That there is now pending before your Honorable House a Bill entitled “A
Bill to continue the Duties on Coal and Wine by the Corporation of
London.”

That the provisions of the said Bill appear to your petitioners to be
pre-eminently calculated to accomplish a great object—viz., the
Embankment of the River Thames, and to provide a low level north sewer
within the same.

That the inhabitants of the kingdom, and particularly of the metropolis,
are greatly interested in the accomplishment of these measures.

That unless this Bill is passed into a law there will be no means of
embanking the Thames, except by an increase of taxation of the
inhabitants of the metropolis, who are already so heavily taxed by the
Main Drainage Rate, and the Sewers and other rates under the various acts
of parliament recently passed for public improvements, and for sanitary
purposes, that they are unable to bear any additional burthen.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honorable House that the said
Bill may pass into law.

And your petitioners will pray, &c.

                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, this thirteenth day of
April, 1861.




APPENDIX No. 25.
HORSE RIDE IN KENSINGTON GARDENS.


                 _To the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty_.

The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea in the County of
Middlesex,

HUMBLY SHEWETH,

That the Vestry aforesaid, believing that the admission of the riding
public into Kensington Gardens, however it may conduce to the recreation
of equestrians, is inconsistent with the comfort and the safety of the
public in general who visit the gardens, and that the riding public have
already great and numerous facilities for horse exercise, pray that your
Majesty will be graciously pleased to direct that the Royal Gardens may
be restored to their former and long established state, and that
pedestrians only may be admitted thereto, as heretofore.

And your Majesty’s memorialists will ever pray.

                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

Given under the common seal of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, this
fourth day of August, 1860.




APPENDIX No. 26.
LOCAL MAGISTRACY.


                _The Vestry Clerk to the Lord Lieutenant_.

                                                      13th February, 1861.

My Lord Marquis,—I am instructed by this Vestry to transmit to your
Lordship a copy of a resolution passed by them at a late meeting.

Resolved,—That the parish of Chelsea, having been deprived of the
services as Magistrates of three gentlemen by death, and another being
about to retire from parochial duties, it is important for the interest
of the parish, that other gentlemen should be appointed in their place,
therefore, that the vestry memorialize the Lord Lieutenant of the county
for the appointment of some gentlemen who will act for the parish in that
capacity.

                                  I have the honor to be, my Lord Marquis,
                    Your Lordship’s most obedient and very humble servant,
                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

The most Honorable the Marquis of Salisbury, K.G., P.C., &c. &c. &c.,
20, Arlington-street, Piccadilly.



                _The Lord Lieutenant to the Vestry Clerk_.

                                              London, February 13th, 1861.

Sir,—In answer to the memorial of the Vestry of the parish of St. Luke,
Chelsea, requesting that magistrates may be appointed to discharge the
parochial duties of the above mentioned parish, I have the honor to
inform you that I do not find it stated as one of the Divisions of the
County in which Petty Sessions are appointed to be held by the Court of
Quarter Sessions.

                                                                  I remain
                                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                       GASCOYNE SALISBURY.

To the Vestry Clerk,
St. Luke’s, Chelsea.




APPENDIX No. 27.
PAROCHIAL ASSESSMENTS BILL.


_To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
                    Ireland in Parliament assembled_.

  The petition of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the County of
                                Middlesex,

SHEWETH,

1.  That a Bill has been introduced into your honourable House,
intituled, “A Bill to Amend the Law relating to Parochial Assessments in
England.”

2.  That your Petitioners view with much alarm many of the provisions of
the said Bill.

3.  That your Petitioners humbly submit that the present law on the
subject is based upon sound principles, and has in the main been found to
be efficient in its operation.

4.  That your Petitioners believe that the present law gives all
necessary protection to those who suffer from the evils resulting from
unjust and unequal assessments.

5.  That the present assessors, namely the Board of Guardians of the Poor
of this Parish, are in consequence of their appointment by the
parishioners, directly amenable to the voice of public opinion.

6.  That by the present Bill it is proposed, that in by far the greater
number of cases, the assessors should be appointed for life, by, and from
amongst the Crown appointed Magistrates of the County.

7.  That your Petitioners believe that the levying and the disbursing of
County Rates by a Board wholly irresponsible to the ratepayers, is a
source of general dissatisfaction throughout the country, dissatisfaction
which will be greatly increased when the large additional powers
contemplated in the Bill are conferred upon the Board.

8.  That the right at present possessed by the ratepayers of appeal to
the General Quarter Sessions against the original assessment, is by the
said Bill taken away, except in the few cases in which some principle of
rating may be involved.

9.  That the evils which it is alleged have arisen under the present law,
may in the opinion of your Petitioners, be remedied by a far less
cumbrous and costly machinery than that proposed by the said Bill.

10.  That the said Bill will, if it pass into law, give unprecedented and
unconstitutional powers to the Assessment Boards created under it.

11.  Your Petitioners, for the foregoing reasons therefore, humbly pray
that the said Bill may not pass into law.

                                                              CHAS. LAHEE,
                                                             Vestry Clerk.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, his twelfth day of March,
1861.

APPENDIX No. 29.
ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE PARISH OF CHELSEA.


    _Statistics laid before Lord Palmerston on the_ 5_th March_, 1861.

The united parishes of Chelsea and Kensington, according to the census in
1851, contained a population of upwards of 100,000 persons; and they are
now rated under Schedule A to the income and property tax, at £693,860.

Of the total number of cities and boroughs in the United Kingdom,
returning members to parliament, fifteen only are rated higher to the
income and property tax than Chelsea and Kensington, while 240 are rated
at a less amount.

There is no un-enfranchised town in the United Kingdom containing half
the population, or assessed at half the amount of property under Schedule
A; and it is therefore respectfully contended that the inhabitants of
Chelsea and Kensington have a paramount claim to any new borough
representation that may be created by the legislature.

 _To the Honorable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
                    Ireland in Parliament assembled_.

The Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the County of
Middlesex,

SHEWETH,

That your Petitioners having had under consideration a Bill about to be
introduced into your honorable House by Viscount Enfield, to transfer the
two seats formerly possessed by the Borough of St. Albans, in the County
of Hertford, to the Parishes of St. Luke, Chelsea, and St. Mary, Abbott’s
Kennington, respectfully represent—

That the claims of the Parish represented by your Petitioners for direct
and separate representation in Parliament are based _inter alia_ upon its
wealth, population, intelligence, and extent.

That the estimated annual value of the house property in the Parish is
about £315,000.

That the Parish of Chelsea extends from the City of Westminster to
Fulham, and contained at the census of 1851, 56,538 inhabitants, and
8,252 houses.

That since the census of 1851, the number of inhabitants has largely
increased, and may be now estimated at 75,000: the number of houses has
also become augmented in like proportion.

That the number of rated householders, according to the last return, was
4,542, and of persons rated, 5,014; but of this number about 700 only
enjoy the Parliamentary franchise.

That the Parish represented by your Petitioners occupies an area of 771

APPENDIX No. 33.
REPORT OF THE AUDITORS, 1860.


We, the undersigned Auditors of Accounts of the Vestry of Chelsea for the
year ending March 25, 1860, present the following report thereon:—

We feel that the accounts submitted to us are not only clear and correct
in themselves, but that they also appear to be presented in a much
simpler and more convenient form than in previous years, although there
still appears to be room for improvement in those departments which
relate to the expenditure incurred under the direction of the Surveyor.
We especially feel that some plan should be adopted for obtaining a
receipt or signature periodically from the labourers employed by him, so
as to assimilate the vouchers in the labour department, as nearly as
circumstances will allow, to those for other departments of expenditure.

We feel it to be especially important that a fuller and more intelligible
system be introduced in reference to deposits paid to the Vestry on
account of Drainage Works and Surveyor’s Licenses, in order that the
amounts actually expended in respect of such deposits may be brought to
account so soon as the works are completed, instead of, as at present,
being brought to account only when the depositor claims the return of the
balance of his deposit; thus leaving it possible that the mere neglect or
ignorance of the depositor may occasion deposit accounts to be left open
and unchecked for years, and that even where sums may be expended in
excess of such deposits, the fact may never come to the knowledge of the
Vestry Clerk, and that consequently no claim may be made on account of
such additional expenditure.

We think, further, that the book which contains a record of such deposits
might, by additional columns of reference, be brought into most useful
connexion with the accounts of the Vestry for payment of the contractors
or others by whom the works are actually executed; thus increasing the
facilities for testing the integrity and propriety of such accounts, and
affording more ready access to any information which depositors may
require in respect of expenditure incurred on their behalf.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS, 1861.


We, the undersigned, have audited the accounts of the Vestry of St. Luke,
Chelsea, for the year expiring 25th March, 1861, and allowed the same
except the item of £21 14s. 9d., charged as the deficiency on the
“Inauguration Dinner,” which after mature consideration we are of
opinion, cannot properly be charged against the Vestry funds.

We find the sum of £533 6s. 8d., amount of Precept dated 8th March, 1856,
uncollected and carried forward from year to year, and would suggest,
that such item be disposed of, by payment being enforced, or the amount
written off.  There does not appear to be any examination of the amount
drawn by the Surveyor for, and that paid to, labourers, and although
attention to this has been drawn by the auditors of the last year’s
accounts, no alteration seems to have been made.  We think that the
Inspector of the Roads should sign the Surveyor’s wages book each week,
in testimony of the number of men charged for, having been employed.

In conclusion, we desire to state our thorough satisfaction with the mode
in which the accounts are kept, and to express our full appreciation of
the courtesy and assistance received from Mr. Lahee during our audit of
such accounts.

To the Vestry of St. Luke, Chelsea.

                                                               G. E. MEAD,

such notice, who shall sign his name, together with the date of his
signature, which date shall be at least seven days before the time fixed
for the next meeting; and no Notice of Motion shall be altered or
withdrawn after such signature, without leave of the Board.

10.  All Notices of Motion, duly entered in such Notice Book, shall be
printed in the Notice of the next ordinary Vestry Meeting, in the order
of their entry.

11.  Any motion, of which notice has been given, shall be proposed by the

to another Vestryman his right to move, or any other Vestryman may bring
forward such motion, or move a negative thereto.

12.  Every motion and amendment must be in writing, and must be seconded

entitled to reply, but shall not introduce new matter; and any Vestrymen
having proposed or seconded a motion or amendment, shall be considered as

18.  The Chairman shall enforce such of the Bye Laws as may be necessary
for the preservation of order, and his decision upon all points of order
shall be final.

22.  No Committee shall be appointed except by motion after due notice;
and whenever the Vestry shall have resolved to appoint a Committee the

the Committee; provided that any other Vestrymen may thereupon move the
addition, omission, or substitution of any Vestryman or Vestrymen as a
member or members of such Committee.

23.  The election of all paid officers shall be by ballot; and no
candidate shall be eligible for election unless he shall have been
proposed and seconded by Members of the Vestry; nor shall there be more
than one ballot for the same office.

24.  Such ballot shall be by means of folding Balloting Papers,
containing the name or (if there be more than one appointment of the same
description) names of the candidate or candidates voted for, which papers
shall be handed, by the Vestrymen voting, to the Chairman, or to some
person deputed by him, and deposited in a balloting box by the Chairman,
or such person who shall count the balloting papers, and state to the
Board the number of them.

25.  Any member of the Vestry objecting to a motion of which notice has
not been given, or to the immediate consideration of a report brought up
by a Committee, may require the same to be placed on the paper for
discussion at the next meeting, unless the Vestry Clerk or Surveyor shall
state that the subject is urgent, in which case the Board shall
determine, by a show of hands, whether the same shall be immediately
considered.

26.  The public are to have access to all books and minutes of the
Vestry, between the hours of 2 and 4 daily; and as soon as adequate

to the ratepayers of the Parish; and it shall be lawful for all members
of the Vestry to attend the Meetings of Committees, but not to take part
in their proceedings.

27.  Special Meetings for revoking and altering resolutions and acts of
the Vestry, as required by the 57th Section, are to be convened on a
requisition to the Clerk, signed by seven members of the Vestry; but no
such Meeting shall be held unless seven day’s notice thereof shall be
given, by notice given to, or sent by post to, or delivered at, the usual
place of abode of each Vestryman, which notice shall state the time and
place of meeting, and shall specify the object thereof; and no business
shall be transacted at any Special Meeting, except such as is stated in
the notice thereof.

28.  In the event of any urgent business requiring in the opinion of the
Clerk an earlier meeting of the Vestry than would take place under the
above (27th) Bye-Law, it shall be his duty to call such meeting, giving
three day’s notice; or if he shall receive a written requisition, signed
by five members, stating the object for which they wish such meeting to
be convened, it shall be equally his duty to call such meeting, at three
day’s notice, out of the usual course, but no subject shall be discussed
at such meeting, except the one stated in the requisition.

                                                                 By Order,

F.G.S., civil engineer.

{9}  Many of the companies have two or three manufacturing stations or
distinct sites at which gas is made, and the wording of the clause will
probably require a testing apparatus to be erected within 1000 yards of
each separate work or manufacturing station.

1859,” that is amended.
