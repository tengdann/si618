NOTES TO III KING HENRY VI.


NOTE I.

II. 1. 95. Pope and Hanmer make no new scene here, although they
evidently intended to do so, as the next scene is marked as Scene III.
In Theobald, as usual, the scenes are not numbered.


NOTE II.

II. 2. 89. In this passage the lines 89–92 are given to ‘Cla.’ in the
first Folio, and to ‘George’ in the Quartos; but it is evident that
Shakespeare, by altering ‘his brother’ in line 92 to ‘me,’ intended the
whole to be spoken by Edward. This is another instance of Shakespeare’s
haste in remodelling the older plays.


NOTE III.

II. 5. 92, 93. Capell follows Hanmer in adopting the reading of the
Quartos. We retain the reading of the Folios, because the alteration
merely transfers the difficulty of explanation from one line to another.


NOTE IV.

III. 1. As Sinklo is certainly the name of an Actor, who is mentioned
in the stage directions in the _Taming of the Shrew_ (Ind. I. 86), and
in _Henry IV._ Pt. II. (Act IV. Sc. 4), there is great probability
that Humfrey is the name of another Actor, perhaps, as Malone suggests,
Humfrey Jeaffes. Neither of these is mentioned in the list of
‘Principal Actors’ prefixed to the first Folio.


NOTE V.

IV. 1. 20–23. The following is the arrangement of these lines in the
Folios:

 ‘Not I: no:
  God forbid, that I should wish them seuer’d,
  Whom God hath ioyn’d together:
  I, and ’twere pittie, to sunder them,
  That yoake so well together.’

Pope reads:

 ‘Not I; no: God forbid that I should wish
  Them severed whom God hath join’d together.
  Pity to sunder them, that yoak so well.’


NOTE VI.

IV. 2. 13. The reading ‘overture’ first appears in Warburton’s
edition, being probably a misprint. Johnson adopts it, but suggests
the true reading ‘coverture,’ without giving any indication that
this was the reading in all the Folios and in all the editions
before Warburton’s. We give this as one of the many instances of the
carelessness with which Johnson’s work was done.


NOTE VII.

IV. 8. In the Folios, Somerset is introduced in the stage direction,
though he had gone with young Richmond into Brittany. The mistake arose
from the Quartos in which Scene VI. and Scene VIII. form but one.


NOTE VIII.

V. 1. 44. This conjecture of Warburton’s, which as he does not
mention it in his edition we have marked ‘withdrawn,’ is found in a
series of unpublished letters from Theobald to Warburton recently added
to the treasures of the British Museum. The first of these letters is
dated Feb. 10, 1729, and the last Sep. 4, 1736. That in which allusion
is made to the passage in question is dated March 10, 1732. Theobald
rejects Warburton’s suggestion, for, he says, ‘Deck’ is ‘a county
dialect,’ meaning the same thing. Among the MSS. recently acquired by
the Museum is a series of letters from Hanmer to Warburton beginning
Dec. 24, 1735, and ending May 25, 1739. In a letter dated July 27,
1737, Hanmer mentions his conjectural reading ‘truss’ for ‘cost’ which
he afterwards inserted in the text of his edition. He defends it thus:
‘when a hawk raiseth a fowl aloft and soaring upwards with it at length
seizeth it in the air, she is said to _truss_ the fowl, which I imagine
is the word which the poor desponding king was made here to apply to
his crown.’


NOTE IX.

V. 2. 48. The first Folio, which the later Folios copy _verbatim_ but
not _literatim_, reads as follows:

 ‘Oh farewell _Warwicke_.
    _Warw._ Sweet rest his Soule:
  Flye Lords, and saue your selues,
  For _Warwicke_ bids you all farewell, to meet in Heauen.’

Pope reads:

 ‘O farewel Warwick.
    _War._ Sweetly rest his soul!
  Fly lords and save your selves, for Warwick bids
  You all farewel, to meet again in heaven.’

Capell:

 ‘O, farewel, Warwick!
    _War._ Sweet rest his soul!--Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
  For Warwick bids farewel, to meet in heaven.’

Rann:

 ‘O, farewel, Warwick!
    _War._ Sweet rest his soul!--
  Fly, lords, and save yourselves; Warwick bids you
  All farewel--to meet in heaven.’

In his edition of 1778 Steevens followed Pope’s arrangement; restoring,
however, ‘Sweet’ for ‘Sweetly’ and omitting ‘again.’

Steevens in later editions gives:

 ‘O, farewell, Warwick!
    _War._ Sweet rest to his soul!--
  Fly, lords, and save yourselves; for Warwick bids
  You all farewell to meet again in heaven.’

The arrangement which we have adopted is exactly that of the Quartos.
Mr Collier was the first of modern editors to introduce it in his text.


NOTE X.

V. 5. We have adhered in the stage directions as nearly as possible
to the Folios, which throughout the play mark no division of the
scenes, except at the end of an Act. Rowe first omitted the _Exeunt._
Theobald, who also continued the scene, gave _Alarm. Retreat.
Excursions. Both Parties go out. Re-enter King Edward_, &c.

Capell first made a new scene here and, altering the relative position
of the stage directions, gave _Exeunt both the Armies._ SC. V.
_Alarums; Excursions; afterwards a Retreat. Then, Enter, as from
Conquest, King Edward, &c._

Capell’s arrangement has, as usual, been followed by subsequent
editors.


NOTE XI.

V. 5. 77, 78.

                 ‘Where is that devil’s butcher,
 Hard-favour’d Richard? Richard, where art thou?’

The reading we have given in the text is that of Steevens, which
appears to be nearest the corresponding passage of the Quartos.

The first Folio has:

         ‘Where is that diuels butcher _Richard_?
 Hard fauor’d _Richard_? _Richard_, where art thou?’

The second Folio:

           ‘Where is that divels butcher _Richard_
 Hard favor’d _Richard_? _Richard_, where art thou?’

The third and fourth put a comma after the first ‘_Richard_,’ the third
reading ‘devils,’ the fourth ‘devil’s.’ Rowe follows the Folios.

Pope has:

                 ‘where is that Devil’s butcher,
 Richard? hard-favour’d Richard, where art thou?’

Theobald:

                 ‘where is that Devil-butcher,
 Richard? hard-favour’d Richard, where art thou?’

Capell:

                 ‘Where is that butcher, Richard?
 Hard-favour’d Richard? Richard, where art thou?’


NOTE XII.

V. 6. We have retained the stage direction of the Folios ‘on the
walls’ instead of adopting Capell’s alteration ‘a Room in the Tower’,
as it seems likely that the mistake lies in the expression ‘another
room’ which was retained from the older play, the author forgetting
that he had changed the scene to the walls.


NOTE XIII.

V. 7. 25. The copy of the first Folio belonging to Lord Ellesmere has
in this place ‘add’ for ‘and.’ In line 27, the same copy reads ‘’tis’
for ‘kis,’ which latter is the word found so far as we know in all
other copies.


NOTE XIV.

V. 7. 30. Steevens says: ‘In my copy of the second Folio, which had
belonged to King Charles the First, his Majesty has erased _Cla._ and
written _King_, in its stead. Shakespeare, therefore, in the catalogue
of his restorers may boast a Royal name.’




The First Part of the Contention of The Two Famovs Houses of _Yorke_ &
_Lancaster_, with the death of the good Duke _Humphrey_.


SCENE I.

_Enter at one doore, King_ HENRY _the sixt, and_ HUMPHREY _Duke

 For in this beautious face thou hast bestowde
 A world of pleasures to my perplexed soule.

 _Queene._ Th’ excessiue loue I beare vnto your grace,

 And nothing can make poore _Margaret_ miserable,
 Vnlesse the frowne of mightie Englands King.

 _Kin._ Her lookes did wound, but now her speech doth pierce,   [daa030]

 _Kin._ How now vnkle, whats the matter that you stay so sodenly.

 _Humph._ Pardon my Lord, a sodain qualme came ouer my hart,   [daa050]
 Which dimmes mine eyes that I can reade no more.   [daa051]
 Vnckle of _Winchester_, I pray you reade on.   [daa052]

 _Cardinall_. _Item_, It is further agreed betweene them, that the
 [daa053] Duches of _Anioy_ and of _Mayne_, shall be released and
 deliuered [daa054] ouer to the King her father, & she sent ouer of the
 King ·daa055· of Englands owne proper cost and charges without dowry.

 _King._ They please vs well, Lord Marquesse kneele downe, We here
 create thee first Duke of _Suffolke_, & girt thee with the sword.
 Cosin of Yorke, We here discharge your grace from being Regent in the
 parts of _France_, till terme of 18. months ·daa060· be full expirde.

 Thankes vnckle _Winchester_, _Gloster_, _Yorke_, and _Buckingham_,
              _Somerset_, _Salsbury_, and _Warwicke_.
 We thanke you all for this great fauour done,   [daa063]
 In entertainment to my Princely Queene,
 Come let vs in, and with all speed prouide   ·daa065·
 To see her Coronation be performde.   [daa066]
               _Exet_ King, Queene, and Suffolke, and Duke Humphrey
                staies all the rest.

 _Humphrey._ Braue Peeres of England, Pillars of the state,   [daa067]
 To you Duke _Humphrey_ must vnfold his griefe,
 What did my brother _Henry_ toyle himselfe,
 And waste his subjects for to conquere _France_?   ·daa070·
 And did my brother _Bedford_ spend his time
 To keepe in awe that stout vnruly Realme?
 And haue not I and mine vnckle _Bewford_ here,
 Done all we could to keepe that land in peace?
 And is all our labours then spent in vaine,   [daa075]
 For Suffolke he, the new made Duke that rules the roast,
 Hath giuen away for our King _Henries_ Queene,
 The Dutches of _Anioy_ and _Mayne_ vnto her father.
 Ah Lords, fatall is this marriage canselling our states,
 Reuersing Monuments of conquered _France_,   ·daa080·
 Vndoing all, as none had nere bene done.

 _Card._ Why how now cosin _Gloster_, what needs this?
 As if our King were bound vnto your will,
 And might not do his will without your leaue,
 Proud Protector, enuy in thine eyes I see,   ·daa085·
 The big swolne venome of thy hatefull heart,
 That dares presume gainst that thy Soueraigne likes.   [daa087]

 _Humphr._ Nay my Lord tis not my words that troubles you,   [daa088]
 But my presence, proud Prelate as thou art:
 But ile begone, and giue thee leaue to speake.   [daa090]
 Farewell my Lords, and say when I am gone,
 I prophesied _France_ would be lost ere long.
               _Exet_ Duke _Humphrey_.

 _Card._ There goes our Protector in a rage,
 My Lords you know he is my great enemy,
 And though he be Protector of the land,   ·daa095·
 And thereby couers his deceitfull thoughts,
 For well you see, if he but walke the streets,   [daa097]
 The common people swarme about him straight,
 Crying Iesus blesse your royall exellence,
 With God preserue the good Duke _Humphrey_.   ·daa100·
 And many things besides that are not knowne,
 Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke _Humphrey_.   [daa112]
 But I will after him, and if I can
 Ile laie a plot to heaue him from his seate.
               _Exet_ Cardinall.

 _Buck._ But let vs watch this haughtie Cardinall,   ·daa105·
 Cosen of _Somerset_ be rulde by me,
 Weele watch Duke _Humphrey_ and the Cardinall too,
 And put them from the marke they faine would hit.

 _Somerset._ Thanks cosin _Buckingham_, ioyne thou with me,
 And both of vs with the Duke of _Suffolke_,   ·daa110·
 Weele quickly heaue Duke _Humphrey_ from his seate.

 _Buck._ Content, Come then let vs about it straight,
 For either thou or I will be Protector.
               _Exet Buckingham and Somerset._

 _Salsb._ Pride went before, Ambition follows after.
 Whilst these do seeke their owne preferments thus,   ·daa115·
 My Lords let vs seeke for our Countries good,
 Oft haue I seene this haughtie Cardinall   [daa117]
 Sweare, and forsweare himselfe, and braue it out,
 More like a Ruffin then a man of Church.   [daa119]
 Cosin _Yorke_, the victories thou hast wonne,   ·daa120·
 In _Ireland_, _Normandie_, and in _France,_
 Hath wonne thee immortall praise in England.
 And thou braue _Warwicke_, my thrice valiant sonne,
 Thy simple plainnesse and thy house-keeping,
 Hath wonne thee credit amongst the common sort,   ·daa125·
 The reuerence of mine age, and _Neuels_ name,
 Is of no little force if I command,
 Then let vs ioyne all three in one for this,
 That good Duke _Humphrey_ may his state possesse,
 But wherefore weepes _Warwicke_ my noble sonne.

 _Warw._ For griefe that all is lost that _Warwick_ won.
 Sonnes. _Anioy_ and _Maine,_ both giuen away at once,   [daa132]

 Why _Warwick_ did win them, & must that then which we wonne with our
 swords, be giuen away with wordes.

 _Yorke._ As I haue read, our Kinges of England were woont to ·daa135·
 haue large dowries with their wiues, but our King _Henry_ giues away
 his owne.

 _Sals._ Come sonnes away and looke vnto the maine.

 _War._ Vnto the _Maine_, Oh father _Maine_ is lost,
 Which _Warwicke_ by maine force did win from _France_,   ·daa140·
 Maine chance father you meant, but I meant _Maine_,   [daa141]
 Which I will win from _France_, or else be slaine.
 _Exet Salsbury_ and _Warwicke_.

 _Yorke._ _Anioy_ and _Maine_, both giuen vnto the French,
 Cold newes for me, for I had hope of _France_,
 Euen as I haue of fertill England.   ·daa145·
 A day will come when _Yorke_ shall claime his owne,
 And therefore I will take the _Neuels_ parts,
 And make a show of loue to proud Duke _Humphrey_:
 And when I spie aduantage, claime the Crowne,
 For thats the golden marke I seeke to hit:   ·daa150·
 Nor shall proud _Lancaster_ vsurpe my right,
 Nor hold the scepter in his childish fist,
 Nor weare the Diademe vpon his head,
 Whose church-like humours fits not for a Crowne:
 Then _Yorke_ be still a while till time do serue,   ·daa155·
 Watch thou, and wake when others be a sleepe,   [daa156]
 To prie into the secrets of the state,
 Till _Henry_ surfeiting in ioyes of loue,
 With his new bride, and Englands dear bought queene,
 And _Humphrey_ with the Peeres be falne at iarres,   ·daa160·
 Then will I raise aloft the milke-white Rose,
 With whose sweete smell the aire shall be perfumde,
 And in my Standard beare the Armes of _Yorke_,
 To graffle with the House of _Lancaster_:   [daa164]
 And force perforce, ile make him yeeld the Crowne,   ·daa165·
 Whose bookish rule hath puld faire England downe.
 _Exet Yorke._


SCENE II.

Enter Duke _Humphrey_, and Dame _Ellanor_,
_Cobham_ his wife.

 _Elnor._ Why droopes my Lord like ouer ripened corne,
 Hanging the head at _Cearies_ plentious loade,   [dab002]
 What seest thou Duke _Humphrey_ King _Henries_ Crowne?
 Reach at it, and if thine arme be too short,
 Mine shall lengthen it. Art not thou a Prince,   [dab005]
 Vnckle to the King, and his Protector?
 Then what shouldst thou lacke that might content thy minde.   [dab007]

 _Humph._ My louely _Nell_, far be it from my heart,
 To thinke of Treasons gainst my soueraigne Lord,
 But I was troubled with a dreame to night,   ·dab010·
 And God I pray, it do betide no ill.   [dab011]

 _Elnor._ What drempt my Lord. Good _Humphrey_ tell it me,   [dab012]
 And ile interpret it, and when thats done,
 Ile tell thee then, what I did dreame to night.

 _Humphrey._ This night when I was laid in bed, I dreampt
               that   [dab015]
 This my staffe mine Office badge in Court,
 Was broke in two, and on the ends were plac’d,   [dab017]
 The heads of the Cardinall of _Winchester_,   [dab018]
 And _William de la Poule_ first Duke of _Suffolke_.   [dab019]

 _Elnor._ Tush my Lord, this signifies nought but this,   ·dab020·
 That he that breakes a sticke of _Glosters_ groue,
 Shall for th’ offence, make forfeit of his head.
 But now my Lord, Ile tell you what I dreampt,
 Me thought I was in the Cathedrall Church
 At Westminster, and seated in the chaire   ·dab025·
 Where Kings and Queenes are crownde, and at my feete   [dab026]
 _Henry_ and _Margaret_ with a Crowne of gold
 Stood readie to set it on my Princely head.

 _Humphrey._ Fie _Nell_. Ambitious woman as thou art,
 Art thou not second woman in this land,   ·dab030·
 And the Protectors wife belou’d of him,   [dab031]
 And wilt thou still be hammering treason thus,   [dab032]
 Away I say, and let me heare no more.

 _Elnor._ How now my Lord. What angry with your _Nell_,
 For telling but her dreame. The next I haue   [dab035]
 Ile keepe to my selfe, and not be rated thus.   [dab036]

 _Humphrey._ Nay _Nell_, Ile giue no credit to a dreame,
 But I would haue thee to thinke on no such things.   [dab038]

    Enters a Messenger.

 _Messenger._ And it please your grace, the King and Queene to morrow
 morning will ride a hawking to Saint Albones, [dab040] and craues your
 company along with them.

 _Humphrey._ With all my heart, I will attend his grace:
 Come _Nell_, thou wilt go with vs vs I am sure.   [dab043]
               _Exet Humphrey._

 _Elnor._ Ile come after you, for I cannot go before,
 But ere it be long, Ile go before them all,   [dab045]
 Despight of all that seeke to crosse me thus,
 Who is within there?

    Enter sir _Iohn Hum_.

 What sir _Iohn Hum_, what newes with you?

 _Sir Iohn._ Iesus preserue your Maiestie.

 _Elnor._ My Maiestie. Why man I am but grace.   ·dab050·

 _Ser Iohn._ I, but by the grace of God & _Hums_ aduise,   [dab051]
 Your graces state shall be aduanst ere long.

 _Elnor._ What hast thou conferd with _Margery Iordaine_, the
 cunning Witch of _Ely_, with _Roger Bullingbrooke_ and the   [dab054]
 rest, and will they vndertake to do me good?   [dab055]

 _Sir Iohn._ I haue Madame, and they haue promised me to raise a
 Spirite from depth of vnder grounde, that shall tell your [dab057]
 grace all questions you demaund.

 _Elnor._ Thanks good sir _Iohn_. Some two daies hence I gesse  [dab059]
 Will fit our time, then see that they be here:   ·dab060·
 For now the King is ryding to Saint Albones,
 And all the Dukes and Earles along with him,
 When they be gone, then safely they may come,   [dab063]
 And on the backside of my Orchard heere,
 There cast their Spelles in silence of the night,   ·dab065·
 And so resolue vs of the thing we wish,   [dab066]
 Till when, drinke that for my sake, And so farwell.
               _Exet Elnor._

 _Sir Iohn._ Now sir _Iohn Hum_, No words but mum.
 Seale vp your lips, for you must silent be,
 These gifts ere long will make me mightie rich.   ·dab070·
 The Duches she thinks now that all is well,
 But I haue gold comes from another place,
 From one that hyred me to set her on,
 To plot these Treasons gainst the King and Peeres,
 And that is the mightie Duke of _Suffolke_.   ·dab075·
 For he it is, but I must not say so,
 That by my meanes must worke the Duches fall,
 Who now by Cuniurations thinkes to rise.   [dab078]
 But whist sir _Iohn,_ no more of that I trow,   [dab079]
 For feare you lose your head before you goe.   ·dab080·
               _Exet._


SCENE III.

Enter two Petitioners, and _Peter_ the Armourers man.

 _1. Peti._ Come sirs let vs linger here abouts a while,   [dac001]
 Vntil my Lord Protector come this way,
 That we may show his grace our seuerall causes.

 _2. Peti._ I pray God saue the good Duke _Humphries_ life,   [dac004]
 For but for him a many were vndone,   ·dac005·
 That cannot get no succour in the Court,   [dac006]
 But see where he comes with the Oueene.

    Enter the Duke of _Suffolke_ with the Queene, and they take him for
    Duke _Humphrey_, and giues him their writings.

 _1. Peti._ Oh we are vndone, this is the Duke of _Suffolke_.

 _Queene._ Now good-fellowes, whom would you speak withall?

 _2. Peti._ If it please your Maiestie, with my Lord Protectors ·dac010·
 Grace.

 _Queene._ Are your sutes to his grace. Let vs see them first, [dac012]
 Looke on them my Lord of _Suffolke_.

 _Suffolke._ A complaint against the Cardinals man,
 What hath he done?   ·dac015·

 _2. Peti._ Marry my Lord, he hath stole away my wife,   [dac016]
 And th’ are gone togither, and I know not where to finde them.

 _Suffolke._ Hath he stole thy wife, thats some iniury indeed. [dac018]
 But what say you?

 _Peter Thump._ Marry sir I come to tel you that my maister said,
 ·dac020· that the Duke of _Yor_k_e_ was true heire vnto the Crowne,
 and [dac021] that the King was an vsurer.

 _Queene._ An vsurper thou wouldst say.

 _Peter._ I forsooth an vsurper. [dac024]

 _Queene._ Didst thou say the King was an vsurper? ·dac025·

 _Peter._ No forsooth, I saide my maister saide so, th’ other day, when
 we were scowring the Duke of _Yorks_ Armour in our garret.

 _Suffolke._ I marry this is something like,
 Whose within there?   [dac030]

    Enter one or two.

 Sirra take in this fellow and keepe him close,   [dac031]
 And send out a Purseuant for his maister straight,
 Weele here more of this before the King.   [dac033]
               _Exet_ with the Armourers man.
 Now sir what yours? Let me see it,   [dac034]
 Whats here?   [dac035]

 A complaint against the Duke of _Suffolke_ for enclosing the commons
 of long Melford.

 How now sir knaue.   [dac038]

 _1. Peti._ I beseech your grace to pardon me, me, I am but a [dac039]
 Messenger for the whole town-ship. ·dac040·

    He teares the papers.

 _Suffolke._ So now show your petitions to Duke _Humphrey_.   [dac041]
 Villaines get you gone and come not neare the Court,   [dac042]
 Dare these pesants write against me thus.   [dac043]
               _Exet_ Petitioners.

 _Queene._ My Lord of _Suffolke_, you may see by this,
 The Commons loues vnto that haughtie Duke,   ·dac045·
 That seekes to him more then to King _Henry_:
 Whose eyes are alwaies poring on his booke,
 And nere regards the honour of his name,   [dac048]
 But still must be protected like a childe,
 And gouerned by that ambitious Duke,   ·dac050·
 That scarse will moue his cap nor speake to vs,   [dac051]
 And his proud wife, high minded _Elanor_,
 That ruffles it with such a troupe of Ladies,
 As strangers in the Court takes her for the Queene.   [dac054]
 The other day she vanted to her maides,   ·dac055·
 That the very traine of her worst gowne,
 Was worth more wealth then all my fathers lands,
 Can any griefe of minde be like to this.   [dac058]
 I tell thee _Poull_, when thou didst runne at Tilt,   [dac059]
 And stolst away our Ladaies hearts in _France_,   [dac060]
 I thought King _Henry_ had bene like to thee,
 Or else thou hadst not brought me out of _France_.

 _Suffolke._ Madame content your selfe a litle while,
 As I was cause of your comming to England,   [dac064]
 So will I in England worke your full content:   ·dac065·
 And as for proud Duke _Humphrey_ and his wife,
 I haue set lime-twigs that will intangle them,
 As that your grace ere long shall vnderstand.
 But staie Madame, here comes the King.   [dac069]

    Enter King _Henry_, and the Duke of _Yorke_ and the Duke of
    _Somerset_ on both sides of the King, whispering with him, and
    enter Duke _Humphrey_, Dame _Elnor_, the Duke of _Buckingham_, the
    Earle of _Salsbury_, the Earle of _Warwicke_, and the Cardinall of
    _Winchester_.

 _King._ My Lords I care not who be Regent in _France_, or _York_,
 ·dac070· or Somerset, alls wonne to me. [dac071]

 _Yorke_ My Lord, if _Yorke_ haue ill demeande himselfe,
 Let _Somerset_ enioy his place and go to _France_.

 _Somerset._ Then whom your grace thinke worthie, let him go,  [dac074]
 And there be made the Regent ouer the French.   ·dac075·

 _Warwicke._ Whom soeuer you account worthie,
 _Yorke_ is the worthiest.

 _Cardinall._ Pease _Warwicke_. Giue thy betters leaue to
               speake.   [dac078]

 _War._ The Cardinals not my better in the field.   [dac079]

 _Buc._ All in this place are thy betters farre.   ·dac080·

 _War._ And _Warwicke_ may liue to be the best of all.   [dac081]

 _Queene._ My Lord in mine opinion, it were best that _Somerset_ were
 Regent ouer _France_.

 _Humphrey._ Madame onr King is old inough himselfe,   [dac084]
 To giue his answere without your consent.   ·dac085·

 _Queene._ If he be old inough, what needs your grace   [dac086]
 To be Protector ouer him so long.

 _Humphrey._ Madame I am but Protector ouer the land,   [dac088]
 And when it please his grace, I will resigne my charge.

 _Suffolke._ Resigne it then, for since that thou wast King,   [dac090]
 As who is King but thee. The common state   [dac091]
 Doth as we see, all wholly go to wracke,
 And Millions of treasure hath bene spent,
 And as for the Regentship of _France_,
 I say _Somerset_ is more worthie then _Yorke_.   [dac095]

 _Yorke._ Ile tell thee _Suffolke_ why I am not worthie,
 Because I cannot flatter as thou canst.

 _War._ And yet the worthie deeds that _York_ hath done,
 Should make him worthie to be honoured here.

 _Suffolke._ Peace headstrong _Warwicke_.   ·dac100·

 _War._ Image of pride, wherefore should I peace?

 _Suffolke._ Because here is a man accusde of Treason,
 Pray God the Duke of _Yorke_ do cleare himselfe.
 Ho, bring hither the Armourer and his man.

    Enter the Armourer and his man.

 If it please your grace, this fellow here, hath accused his maister of
 ·dac105· high Treason, And his words were these.

 That the Duke of _Yorke_ was lawfull heire vnto the Crowne, and
 that your grace was an vsurper.

 _Yorke._ I beseech your grace let him haue what punishment the
 law will afford, for his villany.   ·dac110·

 _King._ Come hether fellow, didst thou speake these words?

 _Armour._ Ant shall please your Maiestie, I neuer said any such
 [dac112] matter, God is my witnesse, I am falsly accused by this
 villain (here.

 _Peter._ Tis no matter for that, you did say so.   ·dac115·

 _Yorke._ I beseech your grace, let him haue the law.

 _Armour._ Alasse my Lord, hang me if euer I spake the words, [dac117]
 my accuser is my prentise, & when I did correct him for his
 fault the other day, he did vow upon his knees that he would
 be euen with me, I haue good witnesse of this, and therefore ·dac120·
 I beseech your Maiestie do not cast away an honest man for [dac121]
 a villaines accusation.

 _King._ Vnckle _Gloster_, what do you thinke of this?

 _Humphrey._ The law my Lord is this by case, it rests suspitious,
 That a day of combat be appointed,   ·dac125·
 And there to trie each others right or wrong,
 Which shall be on the thirtith of this month,   [dac127]
 With _Eben_ staues, and _Standbags_ combatting   [dac128]
 In Smythfield, before your Royall Maiestie.      _Exet Humphrey._

 _Armour._ And I accept the Combat willingly.   ·dac130·

 _Peter._ Alasse my Lord, I am not able to fight.   [dac131]

 _Suffolke._ You must either fight sirra or else be hangde:
 Go take them hence againe to prison.       _Exet_ with them.   [dac133]
               The Queene lets fall her gloue, and hits the Duches of
                 _Gloster_, a boxe on the eare.

 _Queene._ Giue me my gloue. Why Minion can you not see?
 She strikes her.

 I cry you mercy Madame, I did mistake,   ·dac135·
 _I_ did not thinke it had bene you.

 _Elnor._ Did you not proud French-woman,   [dac137]
 Could _I_ come neare your daintie vissage with my nayles,
 Ide set my ten commandments in your face.

 _King._ Be patient gentle Aunt.   ·dac140·
 It was against her will.

 _Elnor._ Against her will. Good King sheele dandle thee,   [dac142]
 If thou wilt alwaies thus be rulde by her.
 But let it rest. As sure as _I_ do liue,
 She shall not strike dame _Elnor_ vnreuengde.   ·dac145·
               _Exet Elnor._

 _King._ Beleeue me my loue, thou wart much to blame,   [dac146]
 I would not for a thousand pounds of gold,
 My noble vnckle had bene here in place.

    Enter Duke _Humphrey_.

 But see where he comes, _I_ am glad he met her not.
 Vnckle _Gloster_, what answere makes your grace   ·dac150·
 Concerning our Regent for the Realme of _France_,
 Whom thinks your grace is meetest for to send.

 _Humphrey._ My gratious Lord, then this is my resolue,
 For that these words the Armourer should speake,   [dac154]
 Doth breed suspition on the part of _Yorke_,   ·dac155·
 Let _Somerset_ be Regent ouer the French,   [dac156]
 Till trials made, and _Yorke_ may cleare himselfe.   [dac157]

 _King._ Then be it so my Lord of _Somerset_.
 We make your grace Regent ouer the French,
 And to defend our rights gainst forraine foes,   [dac160]
 And so do good vnto the Realme of _France_.
 Make hast my Lord, tis time that you were gone,
 The time of Truse I thinke is full expirde.

 _Somerset._ I humbly thanke your royall Maiestie,
 And take my leaue to poste with speed to _France_.   ·dac165·
               _Exet Somerset._

 _King._ Come vnckle _Gloster_, now lets haue our horse,   [dac166]
 For we will to Saint Albones presently,
 Madame your Hawke they say, is swift of flight,
 And we will trie how she will flie to day.   [dac169]
               _Exet omnes._


SCENE IV.

Enter _Elnor_, with sir _Iohn Hum_, _Koger Bullenbrooke_ a Coniurer,
and _Margery Iourdaine_ a Witch.

 _Elnor._ Here sir _Iohn_, take this scrole of paper here,   [dad001]
 Wherein is writ the questions you shall aske,
 And I will stand vpon this Tower here,
 And here the spirit what it saies to you,   [dad004]
 And to my questions, write the answeres downe.   ·dad005·
               She goes vp to the Tower.

 _Sir Iohn._ Now sirs begin and cast your spels about,
 And charme the fiendes for to obey your wils,
 And tell Dame _Elnor_ of the thing she askes.

 _Witch._ Then _Roger Bullinbrooke_ about thy taske,
 And frame a Cirkle here vpon the earth,   ·dad010·
 Whilst I thereon all prostrate on my face,
 Do talke and whisper with the diuels be low,   [dad012]
 And coniure them for to obey my will.
               She lies downe vpon her face.

    _Bullenbrooke_ makes a Cirkle.

 _Bullen._ Darke Night, dread Night, the silence of the Night.
 Wherein the Furies maske in hellish troupes,   ·dad015·
 Send vp I charge you from _Sosetus_ lake,
 The spirit _Askalon_ to come to me,
 To pierce the bowels of this Centricke earth,
 And hither come in twinkling of an eye,
 _Askalon, Assenda, Assenda_.   [dad020]

    It thunders and lightens, and then the spirit riseth vp.

 _Spirit._ Now _Bullenbrooke_ what wouldst thou haue me do?

 _Bullen._ First of the King, what shall become of him?

 _Spirit._ The Duke yet liues that _Henry_ shall depose,
 But him out liue, and dye a violent death.   [dad024]

 _Bullen._ What fate awayt the Duke of _Suffolke_.   [dad025]

 _Spirit._ By water shall he die and take his ende.   [dad026]

 _Bullen._ What shall betide the Duke of _Somerset_?

 _Spirit._ Let him shun Castles, safer shall he be vpon the sandie
 plaines, then where Castles mounted stand.   [dad029]
 Now question me no more, for I must hence againe.   ·dad030·

    He sinkes downe againe.

 _Bullen._ Then downe I say, vnto the damned poule.   [dad031]
 Where Pluto in his firie Waggon sits.
 Ryding amidst the singde and parched smoakes,

SCENE V.

Enter the King and Queene with her Hawke on her fist, and Duke
_Humphrey_ and _Suffolke_, and the Cardinall, as if they came from
hawking.

 _Queene._ My Lord, how did your grace like this last flight?
 But as _I_ cast her off the winde did rise,
 And twas ten to one, old Ione had not gone out.

 _King._ How wonderful the Lords workes are on earth,
 Euen in these silly creatures of his hands,   [dae005]
 Vnckle Gloster, how hie your Hawke did sore?   [dae006]
 And on a sodaine soust the Partridge downe.   [dae007]

 _Suffolke._ No maruell if it please your Maiestie
 My Lord Protectors Hawke done towre so well,   [dae009]
 He knowes his maister loues to be aloft.   [dae010]

 _Humphrey._ Faith my Lord, it is but a base minde   [dae011]
 That can sore no higher than a Falkons pitch.   [dae012]

 _Card._ I thought your grace would be aboue the cloudes.

 _Humph._ I my Lord Cardinall, were it not good   [dae014]
 Your grace could fllie to heauen.   [dae015]

 _Card._ Thy heauen is on earth, thy words and thoughts beat on
 a Crowne, proude Protector dangerous Peere, to smooth it thus

 _Humphrey._ How now my Lord, why this is more then needs,
 Church-men so hote. Good vnckle can you doate.   [dae020]

 _Suffolke._ Why not Hauing so good a quarrell & so bad a
               cause.   [dae021]

 _Humphrey._ As how, my Lord?

 _Suffolke._ As you, my Lord. And it like your Lordly   [dae023]
 Lords Protectorship.

 _Humphrey._ Why Suffolke, England knowes thy insolence.   ·dae025·

 _Queene._ And thy ambition Gloster.

 _King._ Cease gentle Queene, and whet not on these furious
 Lordes to wrath, for blessed are the peace-makers on
 earth.

 _Card._ Let me be blessed for the peace I make,   ·dae030·
 Against this proud Protector with my sword.

 _Humphrey._ Faith holy vnckle, I would it were come to that.

 _Cardinall._ Euen when thou darest.   [dae033]

 _Humphrey._ Dare. I tell rhee Priest, Plantagenets could neuer [dae034]
 brooke the dare.   ·dae035·

 _Card._ _I_ am Plantaganet as well as thou, and sonne to Iohn of
 [dae036] Gaunt.

 _Humph._ In Bastardie.

 _Cardin._ I scorne thy words.

 _Humph._ Make vp no factious numbers, but euen in thine own
 person meete me at the East end of the groue.

 _Card._ Heres my hand, I will.   [dae042]

 _King._ Why how now Lords?

 _Card._ Faith Cousin Gloster, had not your man cast off so soone,
 we had had more sport to day, Come with thy swoord   ·dae045·
 and buckler.

 _Humphrey._ Faith Priest, Ile shaue your Crowne.   [dae047]

 _Cardinall._ Protector, protect thy selfe well.

 _King._ The wind growes high, so doth your chollour Lords.   [dae049]

    Enter one crying, A miracle, a miracle.

 How now, now sirrha, what miracle is it?   [dae050]

 _One._ And it please your grace, there is a man that came blinde
 to S. Albones, and hath receiued his sight at his shrine.   [dae052]

 _King._ Goe fetch him hither, that wee may glorifie the Lord   [dae053]
 with him.

    Enter the Maior of Saint Albones and his brethren with Musicke,
    bearing the man that had bene blind, betweene two in a chaire.

 _King._ Thou happie man, giue God eternall praise,   ·dae055·
 For he it is, that thus hath helped thee.

 _Humphrey._ Where wast thou borne?   [dae057]

 _Poore man._ At _Barwicke_ sir, in the North.   [dae058]

 _Humph._ At _Barwicke_, and come thus far for helpe.   [dae059]

 _Poore man._ I sir, it was told me in my sleepe,   [dae060]
 That sweet saint Albones, should giue me my sight againe.

 _Humphrey._ What art thou lame too?   [dae062]

 _Poore man._ I indeed sir, God helpe me.   [dae063]

 _Humphrey._ How cam’st thou lame?

 _Poore man._ With falling off on a plum-tree.   [dae065]

 _Humph._ Wart thou blind & wold clime plumtrees?   [dae066]

 _Poore man._ Neuer but once sir in all my life,
 My wife did long for plums.

 _Humph._ But tell me, wart thou borne blinde?   [dae069]

 _Poore man._ _I_ truly sir.   ·dae070·

 _Woman._ I indeed sir, he was borne blinde.

 _Humphrey._ What art thou his mother?   [dae072]

 _Woman._ His wife sir.

 _Humphrey._ Hadst thou bene his mother,
 Thou couldst haue better told.   ·dae075·
 Why let me see, I thinke thou canst not see yet.

 _Poore man._ Yes truly maister, as cleare as day.

 _Humphrey._ Saist thou so. What colours his cloake?   [dae078]

 _Poore man._ Why red maister, as red as blood.   [dae079]

 _Humphrey._ And his cloake?   ·dae080·

 _Poore man._ Why thats greene.   [dae081]

 _Humphrey._ And what colours his hose?

 _Poore man._ Yellow maister, yellow as gold.

 _Humphrey._ And what colours my gowne?   [dae084]

 _Poore man._ Blacke sir, as blacke as Ieat.   ·dae085·

 _King._ Then belike he knowes what colour Ieat is on.

 _Suffolke._ And yet _I_ thinke Ieat did he neuer see.   [dae087]

 _Humph._ But cloakes and gownes ere this day many a (one.
 But tell me sirrha, whats my name?   [dae089]

 _Poore man._ Alasse maister I know not.   ·dae090·

 _Humphrey._ Whats his name?   [dae091]

 _Poore man._ _I_ know not.

 _Humphrey._ Nor his?

 _Poore man._ No truly sir.

 _Humphrey_ Nor his name?   ·dae095·

 _Poore man_ No indeed maister.

 _Humphrey_ Whats thine owne name?   [dae097]

 _Poore man._ _Sander_, and it please you maister.

 _Humphrey._ Then Sander sit there, the lyingest knaue in Christendom.
 If thou hadst bene born blind, thou mightest aswell haue [dae100]
 knowne all our names, as thus to name the seuerall colours we doo
 weare. Sight may distinguish of colours, but sodeinly to nominate
 them all, it is impossible. My Lords, saint Albones here hath done a
 [dae103]  Miracle, and would you not thinke his cunning to be great,
 that could restore this Cripple to his legs againe. [dae105]

 _Poore man._ Oh maister I would you could.

 _Humphrey._ My Maisters of saint Albones,   [dae107]
 Haue you not Beadles in your Towne,
 And things called whippes?

 _Mayor._ Yes my Lord, if it please your grace.   ·dae110·

 _Humph._ Then send for one presently.

 _Mayor._ Sirrha, go fetch the Beadle hither straight.
               _Exet_ one.

 _Humph._ Now fetch me a stoole hither by and by.
 Now sirrha, If you meane to saue your selfe from whipping,
 Leape me ouer this stoole and runne away.   ·dae115·

    Enter Beadle.

 _Poore man._ Alasse maister I am not able to stand alone,
 You go about to torture me in vaine.

 _Humph._ Well sir, we must haue you finde your legges.
 Sirrha Beadle, whip him till he leape ouer that same stoole.

 _Beadle._ I will my Lord, come on sirrha, off with your doublet
               quickly.   ·dae120·

 _Poore man._ Alas maister what shall _I_ do, I am not able to
               stand.   [dae122]

    After the Beadle hath hit him one girke, he leapes ouer the stoole
    and runnes away, and they run after him, crying, A miracle, a
    miracle.

 _Hump._ Amiracle, a miracle, let him be taken againe, & whipt
 through euery Market Towne til he comes at Barwicke where he
 was borne.   ·dae125·

 _Mayor._ It shall be done my Lord.        _Exet_ Mayor.

 _Suffolke._ My Lord Protector hath done wonders to day,
 He hath made the blinde to see, and halt to go.   [dae128]

 _Humph._ I but you did greater wonders, when you made whole [dae129]
               Dukedomes flie in a day.   ·dae130·
 Witnesse _France_.

 _King._ Haue done I say, and let me here no more of that.   [dae132]

    Enter the Duke of _Buckingham_.

 What newes brings Duke Humprey of Buckingham?   [dae133]

 _Buck._ Ill newes for some my Lord, and this it is,
 That proud dame Elnor our Protectors wife,   ·dae135·
 Hath plotted Treasons gainst the King and Peeres,
 By wichcrafts, sorceries, and cuniurings,
 Who by such meanes did raise a spirit vp,
 To tell her what hap should betide the state,
 But ere they had finisht their diuellish drift,   ·dae140·
 By Yorke and my selfe they were all surprisde,
 And heres the answere the diuel did make to them.

 _King._ First of the King, what shall become of him?

 _Reads._ The Duke yet liues, that Henry shal depose,
 Yet him out liue, and die a violent death.   [dae145]
 Gods will be done in all.
 What fate awaits the Duke of Suffolke?
 By water shall he die and take his end.

 _Suffolke._ By water must the Duke of Suffolke die?   [dae149]
 It must be so, or else the diuel doth lie.   ·dae150·

 _King._ Let Somerset shun Castles,
 For safer shall he be vpon the sandie plaines,
 Then where Castles mounted stand.

 _Card._ Heres good stuffe, how now my Lord Protector   [dae154]
 This newes I thinke hath turnde your weapons point,   ·dae155·
 I am in doubt youle scarsly keepe your promise.

 _Humphrey._ Forbeare ambitious Prelate to vrge my griefe,
 And pardon me my gratious Soueraigne,
 For here I sweare vnto your Maiestie,
 That I am guiltlesse of these hainous crimes   ·dae160·
 Which my ambitious wife hath falsly done,
 And for she would betraie her soueraigne Lord,
 I here renounce her from my bed and boord,
 And leaue her open for the law to iudge,
 Vnlesse she cleare her selfe of this foule deed.   ·dae165·

 _King._ Come my Lords this night weele lodge in S. Albones,
 And to morrow we will ride to London,
 And trie the vtmost of these Treasons forth,
 Come vnckle Gloster along with vs,
 My mind doth tell me thou art innocent.   _Exet omnes._   [dae170]


SCENE VI.

Enter the Duke of _Yor_k_e_, and the Earles of _Salsbury_ and
_Warwicke_.

 _Yorke._ My Lords our simple supper ended, thus,   [daf001]
 Let me reueale vnto your honours here,
 The right and title of the house of Yorke,
 To Englands Crowne by liniall desent.

 _War._ Then Yorke begin, and if thy claime be good,   ·daf005·
 The Neuils are thy subiects to command.

 _Yorke._ Then thus my Lords.
 Edward the third had seuen sonnes,
 The first was Edward the blacke Prince,
 Prince of Wales.   ·daf010·
 The second was Edmund of Langly,   [daf011]
 Duke of Yorke.
 The third was Lyonell Duke of Clarence.
 The fourth was Iohn of Gaunt,
 The Duke of Lancaster.   ·daf015·
 The fifth was Roger Mortemor, Earle of March.
 The sixt was sir Thomas of Woodstocke,
 William of Winsore was the seuenth and last.

 Now, Edward the blacke Prince he died before his father, and left
 behinde him Richard, that afterwards was King, Crownde by ·daf020· the
 name of Richard the second, and he died without an heire. Edmund of
 Langly Duke of Yorke died, and left behind him two daughters, Anne and
 Elinor.

 Lyonell Duke of Clarence died, and left behinde Alice, Anne, and
 Elinor, that was after married to my father, and by her I ·daf025·
 claime the Crowne, as the true heire to Lyonell Duke of Clarence,
 the third sonne to Edward the third. Now sir. In the [daf027] time
 of Richards raigne, Henry of Bullingbrooke, sonne and heire [daf028]
 to Iohn of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster fourth sonne to Edward the
 third, he claimde the Crowne, deposde the Merthfull King, and ·daf030·
 as both you know, in Pomphret Castle harmlesse Richard was [daf031]
 shamefully murthered, and so by Richards death came the house of
 Lancaster vnto the Crowne.

 _Sals._ Sauing your tale my Lord, as I haue heard, in the raigne of
 Bullenbrooke, the Duke of Yorke did claime the Crowne, and ·daf035·
 but for Owin Glendor, had bene King. [daf036]

 _Yorke._ True. But so it fortuned then, by meanes of that monstrous
 rebel Glendor, the noble Duke of York was done to death, and so euer
 since the heires of Iohn of Gaunt haue possessed the Crowne. But if
 the issue of the elder should sucseed before the issue [daf040] of the
 yonger, then am I lawfull heire vnto the kingdome.

 _Warwicke._ What plaine proceedings can be more plaine, hee [daf042]
 claimes it from Lyonel Duke of Clarence, the third sonne to Edward the
 third, and Henry from Iohn of Gaunt the fourth sonne. So that till
 Lyonels issue failes, his should not raigne. It failes not ·daf045·
 yet, but florisheth in thee & in thy sons, braue slips of such a
 stock. Then noble father, kneele we both togither, and in this priuate
 place, be we the first to honor him with birthright to the Crown.

 _Both._ Long liue Richard Englands royall King.

 _Yorke._ I thanke you both. But Lords I am not your King, vntil
 ·daf050· this sword be sheathed euen in the hart blood of the house of
 Lancaster.

 _War._ Then Yorke aduise thy selfe and take thy time,
 Claime thou the Crowne, and set thy standard vp,
 And in the same aduance the milke-white Rose,   ·daf055·
 And then to gard it, will I rouse the Beare,   [daf056]
 Inuiron’d with ten thousand Ragged-staues
 To aide and helpe thee for to win thy right,
 Maugre the proudest Lord of Henries blood,   [daf059]
 That dares deny the right and claime of Yorke,   ·daf060·
 For why my minde presageth I shall liue   [daf061]
 To see the noble Duke of Yorke to be a King.

 _Yorke._ Thanks noble Warwicke, and Yorke doth hope to see,
 The Earl of Warwicke liue, to be the greatest man in England,
 but the King. Come lets goe.           _Exet omnes._   [daf065]


SCENE VII.

Enter King _Henry_, and the Queene, Duke _Humphrey_, the Duke of
_Suffolke_, and the Duke of _Buckingham_, the _Cardinall_, and Dame
_Elnor Cobham_, led with the Officers, and then enter to them the Duke
of _Yorke_, and the Earles of _Salsbury_ and _Warwicke_.

 _King._ Stand foorth Dame Elnor Cobham Duches of Gloster, [dag001] and
 here the sentence pronounced against thee for these Treasons, [dag002]
 that thou hast committed gainst vs, our States and Peeres. [dag003]

 First for thy hainous crimes, thou shalt two daies in London do
 [dag004] penance barefoote in the streetes, with a white sheete about
 thy ·dag005· bodie, and a waxe Taper burning in thy hand. That done,
 thou shalt be banished for euer into the Ile of Man, there to ende
 thy wretched daies, and this is our sentence erreuocable. Away with
 [dag008] her.

 _Elnor._ Euen to my death, for I haue liued too long.   ·dag010·
               _Exet_ some with _Elnor_.

 _King._ Greeue not noble vnckle, but be thou glad,
 In that these Treasons thus are come to light,
 Least God had pourde his vengeance on thy head,   [dag013]
 For her offences that thou heldst so deare.

 _Humph._ Oh gratious _Henry_, giue me leaue awhile,   [dag015]
 To leaue your grace, and to depart away,
 For sorrowes teares hath gripte my aged heart,
 And makes the fountaines of mine eyes to swell,
 And therefore good my Lord, let me depart.

 _King._ With all my hart good vnkle, when you please,   [dag020]
 Yet ere thou goest, _Humphrey_ resigne thy staffe,
 For Henry will be no more protected,
 The Lord shall be my guide both for my land and me.

 _Humph._ My staffe, I noble Henry, my life and all.   [dag024]
 My staffe, I yeeld as willing to be thine,   [dag025]
 As erst thy noble father made it mine,   [dag026]
 And euen as willing at thy feete I leaue it,
 As others would ambitiously receiue it,
 And long hereafter when I am dead and gone,
 May honourable peace attend thy throne.   ·dag030·

 _King._ Vnkle Gloster, stand vp and go in peace,
 No lesse beloued of vs, then when
 Thou weart Protector ouer my land. _Exet Gloster._   [dag033]

 _Queene._ Take vp the staffe, for here it ought to stand,
 Where should it be, but in King Henries hand?   ·dag035·

 _Yorke._ Please it your Maiestie, this is the day
 That was appointed for the combating
 Betweene the Armourer and his man, my Lord,
 And they are readie when your grace doth please.

 _King._ Then call them forth, that they may trie their
               rightes.   ·dag040·

    Enter at one doore the Armourer and his neighbours, drinking to him
    so much that he is drunken, and he enters with a drum before him,
    and his staffe with a sand-bag fastened to it, and at the other
    doore, his man with a drum and sand-bagge, and Prentises drinking
    to him.

 _1. Neighbor._ Here neighbor Hornor, I drink to you in a cup of
               (Sacke.   [dag041]
 And feare not neighbor, you shall do well inough.

 _2. Neigh._ And here neighbor, heres a cup of Charneco.   [dag043]

 _3. Neigh._ Heres a pot of good double beere, neighbor drinke [dag044]
 And be merry, and feare not your man.   ·dag045·

 _Armourer._ Let it come, yfaith ile pledge you all,
 And a figge for Peter.

 _1. Prentise._ Here Peter I drinke to thee, and be not
               affeard.   [dag048]

 _2. Pren._ Here Peter, heres a pinte of Claret-wine for
               thee.   [dag049]

 _3. Pren._ And heres a quart for me, and be merry Peter,   ·dag050·
 And feare not thy maister, fight for credit of the Prentises.

 _Peter._ I thanke you all, but ile drinke no more,
 Here Robin, and if I die, here I giue thee my hammer,
 And Will, thou shalt haue my aperne, and here Tom,
 Take all the mony that I haue.   [dag055]

 O Lord blesse me, I pray God, for I am neuer able to deale with
 my maister, he hath learnt so much fence alreadie.   [dag057]

 _Salb._ Come leaue your drinking, and fall to blowes.
 Sirrha, whats thy name?   [dag059]

 _Pettr._ Peter forsooth.   ·dag060·

 _Salbury._ Peter, what more?

 _Peter._ _Thumpe_.

 _Salsbury._ Thumpe, then see that thou thumpe thy maister.

 _Armour._ Heres to thee neighbour, fill all the pots again, for before
 [dag064] we fight, looke you, I will tell you my minde, for I am come
 ·dag065· hither as it were of my mans instigation, to proue my selfe
 an honest [dag066] man, and Peter a knaue, and so haue at you Peter
 with downright blowes, as Beuys of South-hampton fell vpon Askapart.

 _Peter._ Law you now, I told you hees in his fence alreadie.   [dag069]
               Alarmes, and Peter hits him on the head and fels him.

 _Armou._ Hold Peter, I confesse, Treason, treason.   He dies.  ·dag070·

 _Peter._ O God I giue thee praise.      He kneeles downe.

 _Pren._ Ho well done Peter. God saue the King.

 _King._ Go take hence that Traitor from our sight,
 For by his death we do perceiue his guilt,
 And God in iustice hath reuealde to vs,   ·dag075·
 The truth and innocence of this poore fellow,
 Which he had thought to haue murthered wrongfully.
 Come fellow, follow vs for thy reward. _Exet omnis._   [dag078]


SCENE VIII.

Enter Duke _Humphrey_ and his men, in mourning cloakes.

 _Humph._ Sirrha, whats a clocke?   [dah001]

 _Seruing._ Almost ten my Lord.

 _Humph._ Then is that wofull houre hard at hand,
 That my poore Lady should come by this way,
 In shamefull penance wandring in the streetes,   ·dah005·
 Sweete Nell, ill can thy noble minde abrooke,
 The abiect people gazing on thy face,
 With enuious lookes laughing at thy shame,
 That earst did follow thy proud Chariot wheeles,
 When thou didst ride in tryumph through the streetes.   ·dah010·

    Enter Dame _Elnor Cobham_, bare-foote, and a white sheete about
    her, with a waxe candle in her hand, and verses written on her
    backe and pind on, and accompanied with the Sheriffes of London,
    and Sir _Iohn Standly_, and Officers, with billes and holbards.

 _Seruing._ My gratious Lord, see where my Lady comes,
 Please it your grace, weele take her from the Sheriffes?

 _Humph._ I charge you for your liues stir not a foote,
 Nor offer once to draw a weapon here,
 But let them do their office as they should.   ·dah015·

 _Elnor._ Come you my Lord to see my open shame?
 Ah Gloster, now thou doest penance too,   [dah017]
 See how the giddie people looke at thee,
 Shaking their heads, and pointing at thee heere,
 Go get thee gone, and hide thee from their sights,   ·dah020·
 And in thy pent vp studie rue my shame,
 And ban thine enemies. Ah mine and thine.

 _Hum._ Ah Nell, sweet Nell, forget this extreme grief,
 And beare it patiently to ease thy heart.

 _Elnor._ Ah Gloster teach me to forget my selfe,   ·dah025·
 For whilst I thinke I am thy wedded wife,
 Then thought of this, doth kill my wofull heart.   [dah027]
 The ruthlesse flints do cut my tender feete,
 And when I start the cruell people laugh,
 And bids me be aduised how I tread,   ·dah030·
 And thus with burning Taper in my hand,
 Malde vp in shame with papers on my backe,
 Ah, Gloster, can I endure this and liue.   [dah033]
 Sometime ile say I am Duke _Humphreys_ wife,
 And he a Prince, Protector of the land,   ·dah035·
 But so he rulde, and such a Prince he was,
 As he stood by, whilst I his forelorne Duches
 Was led with shame, and made a laughing stocke,
 To euery idle rascald follower.   [dah039]

 _Humphrey._ My louely Nell, what wouldst thou haue me do?   ·dah040·
 Should I attempt to rescue thee from hence,
 I should incurre the danger of the law,
 And thy disgrace would not be shadowed so.

 _Elnor._ Be thou milde, and stir not at my disgrace,
 Vntill the axe of death hang ouer thy head,   [dah045]
 As shortly sure it will. For Suffolke he,
 The new made Duke, that may do all in all
 With her that loues him so, and hates vs all,
 And impious Yorke and Bewford that false Priest,
 Haue all lymde bushes to betraie thy wings,   ·dah050·
 And flie thou how thou can they will intangle thee.   [dah051]

    Enter a Herald of Armes.

 _Herald._ I summon your Grace, vnto his highnesse Parlament
 holden at saint Edmunds-Bury, the first of the next month.   [dah053]

 _Humphrey._ A Parlament and our consent neuer craude
 Therein before. This is sodeine.   [dah055]
 Well, we will be there.
               _Exet. Herald._

          Maister Sheriffe, I pray proceede no further against my
                     Lady, then the course of law extendes.

 _Sheriffe._ Please it your grace, my office here doth end,
 And I must deliuer her to sir Iohn Standly,   [dah060]
 To be conducted into the Ile of Man.

 _Humphrey._ Must you sir Iohn conduct my Lady?

 _Standly._ _I_ my gratious Lord, for so it is decreede,   [dah063]
 And _I_ am so commanded by the King.

 _Humph._ _I_ pray you sir Iohn, vse her neare the worse,   [dah065]
 In that _I_ intreat you to vse her well.
 The world may smile againe and I may liue,
 To do you fauour if you do it her,
 And so sir Iohn farewell.

 _Elnor._ What gone my Lord, and bid me not farwell?   [dah070]

 _Humph._ Witnesse my bleeding heart, I cannot stay to speake.
               _Exet Hnmphrey_ and his men.

 _Elnor._ Then is he gone, is noble Gloster gone,
 And doth Duke Humphrey now forsake me too?
 Then let me haste from out faire Englands boundes,
 Come Standly come, and let vs haste away.   ·dah075·

 _Standly._ Madam lets go vnto some house hereby,   [dah076]
 Where you may shift your selfe before we go.

 _Elnor._ Ah good sir Iohn, my shame cannot be hid,
 Nor put away with casting off my sheete:
 But come let vs go, maister Sheriffe farewell,   ·dah080·
 Thou hast but done thy office as thou shoulst.   [dah081]
               _Exet omnes._


SCENE IX.

Enter to the Parlament.

Enter two Heralds before, then the Duke of _Buckingham_, and the Duke
of _Suffolke_, and then the Duke of _Yorke_, and the _Cardinall_ of
_Winchester_, and then the King and the Oueene, and then the Earle of
_Salisbury_, and the Earle of _Warwicke_.

 _King._ I wonder our vnkle Gloster staies so long.   [dai001]

 _Queene._ Can you not see, or will you not perceiue,   [dai002]
 How that ambitious Duke doth vse himselfe?
 The time hath bene, but now that time is past.   [dai004]
 That none so humble as Duke Humphrey was.   ·dai005·
 But now let one meete him euen in the morne,
 When euery one will giue the time of day,
 And he will neither moue nor speake to vs.   [dai008]
 See you not how the Commons follow him   [dai009]
 In troupes, crying, God saue the good Duke Humphrey,   ·dai010·
 And with long life, Iesus preserue his grace,   [dai011]
 Honouring him as if he were their King.   [dai012]
 Gloster is no litle man in England,
 And if he list to stir commotions,
 Tys likely that the people will follow him.   ·dai015·
 My Lord, if you imagine there is no such thing,
 Then let it passe, and call it a womans feare.   [dai017]
 My Lord of Suffolke, Buckingham, and Yorke,
 Disproue my Alligations if you can,   [dai019]
 And by your speeches, if you can reproue me,   ·dai020·
 I will subscribe and say, I wrong’d the Duke.

 _Suffol._ Well hath your grace foreseen into that Duke,
 And if I had bene licenst first to speake,
 I thinke I should haue told your graces tale.
 Smooth runs the brooke whereas the streame is deepest   ·dai025·
 No, no, my soueraigne, Gloster is a man
 Vnsounded yet, and full of deepe deceit.

    Enter the Duke of _Somerset_.

 _King._ Welcome Lord Somerset, what newes from France?

 _Somer._ Cold newes my Lord, and this it is,
 That all your holds and Townes within those Territores   [dai030]
 Is ouercome my Lord, all is lost.

 _King._ Cold newes indeed Lord Somerset,
 But Gods will be done.

 _Yorke._ Cold newes for me, for I had hope of France,
 Euen as I haue of fertill England.   ·dai035·

    Enter Duke _Humphrey_.

 _Hum._ Pardon my liege, that I haue staid so long.

 _Suffol._ Nay, Gloster know, that thou art come too soone,
 Vnlesse thou proue more loyall then thou art,
 We do arrest thee on high treason here.

 _Humph._ Why Suffolkes Duke thou shalt not see me blush   ·dai040·
 Nor change my countenance for thine arrest,
 Whereof am I guiltie, who are my accusers?   [dai042]

 _York._ Tis thought my lord, your grace tooke bribes from France,
 And stopt the soldiers of their paie,
 By which his Maiestie hath lost all France.   [dai045]

 _Humph._ Is it but thought so, and who are they that thinke
               so?   [dai046]
 So God helpe me, as I haue watcht the night   [dai047]
 Euer intending good for England still,
 That penie that euer I tooke from France,
 Be brought against me at the iudgement day.   ·dai050·
 I neuer robd the soldiers of their paie,
 Many a pound of mine owne propper cost
 Haue I sent ouer for the soldiers wants,
 Because I would not racke the needie Commons.

 _Car._ In your Protectorship you did deuise   ·dai055·
 Strange torments for offendors, by which meanes   [dai056]
 England hath bene defamde by tyrannie.

 _Hum._ Why tis wel knowne that whilst I was protector
 Pitie was all the fault that was in me,
 A murtherer or foule felonous theefe,   [dai060]
 That robs and murthers silly passengers,   [dai061]
 I tortord aboue the rate of common law.   [dai062]

 _Suffolk._ Tush my Lord, these be things of no account,
 But greater matters are laid vnto your charge,
 I do arrest thee on high treason here,   ·dai065·
 And commit thee to my good Lord Cardinall,
 Vntill such time as thou canst cleare thy selfe.

 _King._ Good vnkle obey to his arrest,
 _I_ haue no doubt but thou shalt cleare thy selfe,
 My conscience tels me thou art innocent.   ·dai070·

 _Hump._ Ah gratious Henry these daies are dangerous,
 And would my death might end these miseries,
 And staie their moodes for good King Henries sake,
 But I am made the Prologue to their plaie,
 And thousands more must follow after me,   ·dai075·
 That dreads not yet their liues destruction.
 Suffolkes hatefull tongue blabs his harts malice,   [dai077]
 Bewfords firie eyes showes his enuious minde,
 Buckinghams proud lookes bewraies his cruel thoughts,
 And dogged Yorke that leuels at the Moone   ·dai080·
 Whose ouerweening arme _I_ haue held backe.
 All you haue ioynd to betraie me thus:
 And you my gratious Lady and soueraigne mistresse,
 Causelesse haue laid complaints vpon my head,
 I shall not want false witnesses inough,   [dai085]
 That so amongst you, you may haue my life.
 The Prouerbe no doubt will be well performde,   [dai087]
 A staffe is quickly found to beate a dog.

 _Suffolke._ Doth he not twit our soueraigne Lady here,
 As if that she with ignomious wrong,   [dai090]
 Had sobornde or hired some to sweare against his life.   [dai091]

 _Queene._ I but I can giue the loser leaue to speake.   [dai092]

 _Humph._ Far truer spoke then ment, I loose indeed,
 Beshrow the winners hearts, they plaie me false.   [dai094]

 _Buck._ Hele wrest the sence and keep vs here all day,   ·dai095·
 My Lord of Winchester, see him sent away.

 _Car._ Who’s within there? Take in Duke Humphrey,
 And see him garded sure within my house.

 _Humph._ O! thus King Henry casts away his crouch,
 Before his legs can beare his bodie vp,   ·dai100·
 And puts his watchfull shepheard from his side,
 Whilst wolues stand snarring who shall bite him first.
 Farwell my soueraigne, long maist thou enjoy,
 Thy fathers happie daies free from annoy.
               _Exet Humphrey_, with the _Cardinals_ men.

 _King._ My Lords what to your wisdoms shal seem best,   ·dai105·
 Do and vndo as if our selfe were here.

 _Queen._ What wil your highnesse leaue the Parlament?

 _King._ I Margaret. My heart is kild with griefe,   [dai108]
 Where I may sit and sigh in endlesse mone,
 For who’s a Traitor, Gloster he is none.   [dai110]
               _Exet King, Salsbury_, and _Warwicke_.

 _Queene._ Then sit we downe againe my Lord Cardinall,
 Suffolke, Buckingham, Yorke, and Somerset.
 Let vs consult of proud Duke Humphries fall.
 In mine opinion it were good he dide,
 For safetie of our King and Common-wealth.   ·dai115·

 _Suffolke._ And so thinke _I_ Madame, for as you know,
 If our King Henry had shooke hands with death,
 Duke Humphrey then would looke to be our King:
 And it may be by pollicie he workes,
 To bring to passe the thing which now we doubt,   ·dai120·
 The Foxe barkes not when he would steale the Lambe,
 But if we take him ere he do the deed,
 We should not question if that he should liue.
 No. Let him die, in that he is a Foxe,   [dai124]
 Least that in liuing he offend vs more.   [dai125]

 _Car._ Then let him die before the Commons know,
 For feare that they do rise in Armes for him.

 _Yorke._ Then do it sodainly my Lords.

 _Suffol._ Let that be my Lord Cardinals charge & mine.

 _Car._ Agreed, for hee’s already kept within my house.   ·dai130·

    Enter a Messenger.

 _Queene._ How now sirrha, what newes?

 _Messen._ Madame I bring you newes from Ireland,
 The wilde Onele my Lords, is vp in Armes,   [dai133]
 With troupes of Irish Kernes that vncontrold,   [dai134]
 Doth plant themselues within the English pale.   [dai135]

 _Queene._ What redresse shal we haue for this my Lords?

 _Yorke._ Twere very good that my Lord of Somerset   [dai137]
 That fortunate Champion were sent ouer,
 And burnes and spoiles the Country as they goe.   [dai139]
 To keepe in awe the stubborne Irishmen,   ·dai140·
 He did so much good when he was in France.

 _Somer._ Had Yorke bene there with all his far fetcht
 Pollices, he might haue lost as much as I.   [dai143]

 _Yorke._ I, for Yorke would haue lost his life before   [dai144]
 That France should haue reuolted from Englands rule.   [dai145]

 _Somer._ I so thou might’st, and yet haue gouernd worse then I.

 _York._ What worse then nought, then a shame take all.   [dai147]

 _Somer._ Shame on thy selfe, that wisheth shame.

 _Queene._ Somerset forbeare, good Yorke be patient,
 And do thou take in hand to crosse the seas,   ·dai150·
 With troupes of Armed men to quell the pride
 Of those ambitious Irish that rebell.

 _Yorke._ Well Madame sith your grace is so content,
 Let me haue some bands of chosen soldiers,
 And Yorke shall trie his fortune against those kernes.   [dai155]

 _Queene._ Yorke thou shalt. My Lord of Buckingham,   [dai156]
 Let it be your charge to muster vp such souldiers
 As shall suffise him in these needfull warres.

 _Buck._ Madame I will, and leauie such a band   [dai159]
 As soone shall ouercome those Irish Rebels,   ·dai160·
 But Yorke, where shall those soldiers staie for thee?

 _Yorke._ At Bristow, I wil expect them ten daies hence.   [dai162]

 _Buc._ Then thither shall they come, and so farewell.
               _Exet Buckingham._

 _Yorke._ Adieu my Lord of Buckingham.

 _Queene._ Suffolke remember what you haue to do.   ·dai165·
 And you Lord Cardinall concerning Duke Humphrey,
 Twere good that you did see to it in time,   [dai167]
 Come let vs go, that it may be performde.   [dai168]
               _Exet omnis, Manit Yorke._

 _York._ Now York bethink thy self and rowse thee vp.
 Take time whilst it is offered thee so faire,   ·dai170·
 Least when thou wouldst, thou canst it not attaine,   [dai171]
 Twas men I lackt, and now they giue them me,   [dai172]
 And now whilst I am busie in Ireland,
 I haue seduste a headstrong Kentishman,
 Iohn Cade of Ashford,   ·dai175·
 Vnder the title of Iohn Mortemer,   [dai176]
 To raise commotion, and by that meanes
 I shall perceiue how the common people
 Do affect the claime and house of Yorke,
 Then if he haue successe in his affaires,   ·dai180·
 From Ireland then comes Yorke againe,
 To reape the haruest which that coystrill sowed,
 Now if he should be taken and condemd,
 Heele nere confesse that I did set him on,
 And therefore ere I go ile send him word,   ·dai185·
 To put in practise and to gather head.
 That so soone as I am gone he may begin
 To rise in Armes with troupes of country swaines,
 To helpe him to performe this enterprise.
 And then Duke Humphrey, he well made away,   ·dai190·
 None then can stop the light to Englands Crowne,
 But Yorke can tame and headlong pull them downe.
               _Exet Yorke._


SCENE X.

Then the Curtaines being drawne, Duke _Humphrey_ is discouered in his
bed, and two men lying on his brest and smothering him in his bed. And
then enter the Duke of _Suffolke_ to them.

 _Suffolk._ How now sirs, what haue you dispatcht him?

 _One._ I my Lord, hees dead I warrant you.   [daj002]

 _Suffolke._ Then see the cloathes laid smooth about him still,
 That when the King comes, he may perceiue
 No other, but that he dide of his owne accord.   ·daj005·

 _2._ All things is hansome now my Lord.   [daj006]

 _Suffolke._ Then draw the Curtaines againe and get you gone,
 And you shall haue your firme rewarde anon.   [daj008]
               _Exet_ murtherers.

    Then enter the King and Queene, the Duke of _Buckingham_, and the
    Duke of _Somerset_, and the Cardinall.

 _King._ My Lord of Suffolke go call our vnkle (Gloster,
 Tell him this day we will that he do cleare himselfe.   ·daj010·

 _Suffolke._ I will my Lord.      _Exet Suffolke._

 _King._ And good my Lords proceed no further against our vnkle
               (Gloster,   [daj012]
 Then by iust proofe you can affirme,
 For as the sucking childe or harmlesse lambe,
 So is he innocent of treason to our state.   ·daj015·

    Enter _Suffolke_.

 How now Suffolke, where’s our unkle?

 _Suffolke._ Dead in his bed, my Lord Gloster is dead.   [daj017]
               The King falles in a sound.

 _Queen._ Ay-me, the King is dead: help, help, my Lords.

 _Suffolke._ Comfort my Lord, gratious Henry comfort.

 _Kin._ What doth my Lord of Suffolk bid me comfort?
 Came he euen now to sing a Rauens note,
 And thinkes he that the cherping of a Wren,
 By crying comfort through a hollow voice,
 Can satisfie my griefes, or ease my heart:   [daj024]
 Thou balefull messenger out of my sight,   [daj025]
 For euen in thine eye-bals murther sits,   [daj026]
 Yet do not goe. Come Basaliske   [daj027]
 And kill the silly gazer with thy lookes.   [daj028]

 _Queene._ Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolke thus,
 As if that he had causde Duke Humphreys death?   ·daj030·
 The Duke and I too, you know were enemies,
 And you had best say that I did murther him.   [daj032]

 _King._ Ah woe is me, for wretched Glosters death.

 _Queene._ Be woe for me more wretched then he was,
 What doest thou turne away and hide thy face?   [daj035]
 I am no loathsome leoper looke on me,   [daj036]
 Was I for this nigh wrackt vpon the sea,   [daj037]
 And thrise by aukward winds driuen back from Englands
               bounds,   [daj038]
 What might it bode, but that well foretelling
 Winds, said, seeke not a scorpions neast.   ·daj040·

    Enter the Earles of _Warwicke_ and _Salisbury_.

 _War._ My Lord, the Commons like an angrie hiue of bees,   [daj041]
 Run vp and downe, caring not whom they sting,
 For good Duke Humphreys death, whom they report   [daj043]
 To be murthered by Suffolke and the Cardinall here.

 _King._ That he is dead good Warwick, is too true,   ·daj045·
 But how he died God knowes, not Henry.

 _War._ Enter his priuie chamber my Lord and view the bodie.
 Good father staie you with the rude multitude, till I returne.

 _Salb._ I will sonne.             _Exet Salbury._
               _Warwicke_ drawes the curtaines and showes Duke
                 _Humphrey_ in his bed.

 _King._ Ah vnkle Gloster, heauen receive thy soule.   ·daj050·
 Farewell poore Henries ioy, now thou art gone.

 _War._ Now by his soule that tooke our shape vpon him,
 To free vs from his fathers dreadfull curse,
 I am resolu’d that violent hands were laid,
 Vpon the life of this thrise famous Duke.   [daj055]

 _Suffolk._ A dreadfull oth sworne with a solemne toong,   [daj056]
 What instance giues Lord Warwicke for these words?

 _War._ Oft haue I seene a timely parted ghost,
 Of ashie semblance, pale and bloodlesse,
 But loe the blood is setled in his face,   [daj060]
 More better coloured then when he liu’d,
 His well proportioned beard made rough and sterne,   [daj062]
 His fingers spred abroad as one that graspt for life,
 Yet was by strength surprisde, the least of these are probable,
 It cannot chuse but he was murthered.   [daj065]

 _Queene._ Suffolke and the Cardinall had him in charge,
 And they _I_ trust sir, are no murtherers.

 _War._ I, but twas well knowne they were not his friends,   [daj068]
 And tis well seene he found some enemies.

 _Card._ But haue you no greater proofes then these?   [daj070]

 _War._ Who sees a hefer dead and bleeding fresh,   [daj071]
 And sees hard-by a butcher with an axe,   [daj072]
 But will suspect twas he that made the slaughter?
 Who findes the partridge in the puttocks neast,
 But will imagine how the bird came there,   ·daj075·
 Although the kyte soare with vnbloodie beake?
 Euen so suspitious is this Tragidie.

 _Queene._ Are you the kyte Bewford, where’s your talants?   [daj078]
 Is Suffolke the butcher, where’s his knife?

 _Suffolke._ I weare no knife to slaughter sleeping men,   ·daj080·
 But heres a vengefull sword rusted with case,   [daj081]
 That shall be scoured in his rankorous heart,   [daj082]
 That slanders me with murthers crimson badge,
 Say if thou dare, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
 That I am guiltie in Duke Humphreys death.   ·daj085·
               _Exet Cardinall._

 _War._ What dares not Warwicke, if false Suffolke dare him?

 _Queene_. He dares not calme his contumelious spirit,
 Nor cease to be an arrogant controwler,
 Though Suffolk dare him twentie hundreth times.   [daj089]

 _War._ Madame be still, with reuerence may I say it,   [daj090]
 That euery word you speake in his defence,
 Is slaunder to your royall Maiestie.

 _Suffolke._ Blunt witted Lord, ignoble in thy words,
 If euer Lady wrongd her Lord so much,
 Thy mother tooke vnto her blamefull bed,   ·daj095·
 Some sterne vntutred churle, and noble stocke   [daj096]
 Was graft with crabtree slip, whose frute thou art,
 And neuer of the Neuels noble race.

 _War._ But that the guilt of murther bucklers thee,
 And I should rob the deaths man of his fee,   [daj100]
 Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
 And that my soueraignes presence makes me mute,
 I would false murtherous coward on thy knees
 Make thee craue pardon for thy passed speech,
 And say it was thy mother that thou meants,   [daj105]
 That thou thy selfe was borne in bastardie,
 And after all this fearefull homage done,
 Giue thee thy hire and send thy soule to hell,   [daj108]
 Pernitious blood-sucker of sleeping men.

 _Suffol._ Thou shouldst be waking whilst I shead thy blood,   ·daj110·
 If from this presence thou dare go with me.

 _War._ Away euen now, or I will drag thee hence.

    Warwicke puls him out.

    _Exet Warwicke_ and _Suffolke_, and then all the Commons within,
    cries, downe with _Suffolke_, downe with _Suffolk_. And then enter
    againe, the Duke of _Suffolke_ and _Warwicke_, with their weapons
    drawne.

 _King._ Why how now Lords?

 _Suf._ The Traitorous Warwicke with the men of Berry,
 Set all vpon me mightie soueraigne i   [daj115]

    The Commons againe cries, downe with _Suffolke_, downe with
    _Suffolke_. And then enter from them, the Earle of _Salbury_.

 _Salb._ My Lord, the Commons sends you word by me,   [daj116]
 The vnlesse false Suffolke here be done to death,   [daj117]
 Or banished faire Englands Territories,
 That they will erre from your highnesse person,
 They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died,   ·daj120·
 They say by him they feare the ruine of the realme.
 And therefore if you loue your subiects weale,
 They wish you to banish him from foorth the land.   [daj123]

 _Suf._ Indeed tis like the Commons rude vnpolisht hinds
 Would send such message to their soueraigne,   ·daj125·
 But you my Lord were glad to be imployd,
 To trie how quaint an Orator you were,
 But all the honour Salsbury hath got,
 Is, that he was the Lord Embassador
 Sent from a sort of Tinkers to the King.   ·daj130·

    The Commons cries, an answere from the King, my Lord of _Salsbury_.

 _King._ Good Salsbury go backe againe to them,
 Tell them we thanke them all for their louing care,   [daj132]
 And had I not bene cited thus by their meanes,   [daj133]
 My selfe had done it. Therefore here I sweare,
 If Suffolke be found to breathe in any place,   ·daj135·
 Where I haue rule, but three daies more, he dies.
               _Exet Salisbury._

 _Queene._ Oh Henry, reuerse the doome of gentle Suffolkes banishment.

 _King._ Vngentle Queene to call him gentle Suffolke,
 Speake not for him, for in England he shall not rest,
 If I say, I may relent, but if I sweare, it is erreuocable.   [daj140]
 Come good Warwicke and go thou in with me,   [daj141]
 For I haue great matters to impart to thee.
               _Exet_ King and _Warwicke_, _Manet_ Queene
                 and _Suffolke_.

 _Queene._ Hell fire and vengeance go along with you,
 Theres two of you, the diuell make the third.   [daj144]
 Fie womanish man, canst thou not curse thy enemies?   ·daj145·

 _Suffolke._ A plague vpon them, wherefore should _I_ curse them?
 Could curses kill as do the Mandrakes groanes,
 I would inuent as many bitter termes
 Deliuered strongly through my fixed teeth,
 With twise so many signes of deadly hate,   ·daj150·
 As leaue fast enuy in her loathsome caue,   [daj151]
 My toong should stumble in mine earnest words,
 Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint,
 My haire be fixt on end, as one distraught,
 And euery ioynt should seeme to curse and ban,   ·daj155·
 And now me-thinks my burthened hart would breake,   [daj156]
 Should _I_ not curse them. Poison be their drinke,
 Gall worse then gall, the daintiest thing they taste.
 Their sweetest shade a groue of sypris trees,   [daj159]
 Their softest tuch as smart as lyzards stings.   ·daj160·
 Their musicke frightfull, like the serpents hys.
 And boding scrike-oules make the consort full.   [daj162]
 All the foule terrors in darke seated hell.

 _Queene._ Inough sweete Suffolke, thou torments thy (selfe.   [daj164]

 _Suffolke._ You bad me ban, and will you bid me sease?   [daj165]
 Now by this ground that I am banisht from,
 Well could I curse away a winters night,
 And standing naked on a mountaine top,
 Where byting cold would neuer let grasse grow,
 And thinke it but a minute spent in sport.   ·daj170·

 _Queene._ No more. Sweete Suffolke hie thee hence to _France_,
 Or liue where thou wilt within this worldes globe,
 Ile haue an Irish that shall finde thee out,   [daj173]
 And long thou shalt not staie, but ile haue thee repelde,
 Or venture to be banished my selfe.   [daj175]
 Oh let this kisse be printed in thy hand,
 That when thou seest it, thou maist thinke on me.
 Away, I say, that I may feele my griefe,
 For it is nothing whilst thou standest here.

 _Suffolke._ Thus is poore _Suffolke_ ten times banished,   ·daj180·
 Once by the King, but three times thrise by thee.

    Enter _Vawse_.

 _Queene._ How now, whither goes Vawse so fast?

 _Vawse._ To signifie vnto his Maiestie,
 That Cardinall Bewford is at point of death,
 Sometimes he raues and cries as he were madde,   ·daj185·
 Sometimes he cals vpon Duke Humphries Ghost,
 And whispers to his pillow as to him,
 And sometime he calles to speake vnto the King,   [daj188]
 And I am going to certifie vnto his grace,
 That euen now he cald aloude for him.   ·daj190·

 _Queene._ Go then good Vawse and certifie the King      _Exet Vawse._
 Oh what is worldly pompe, all men must die,   [daj192]
 And woe am I for Bewfords heauie ende.
 But why mourne I for him, whilst thou art here?
 Sweete Suffolke hie thee hence to France,   ·daj195·
 For if the King do come, thou sure must die.

 _Suff._ And if I go I cannot liue: but here to die,
 What were it else, but like a pleasant slumber   [daj198]
 In thy lap?
 Here could I, could I, breath my soule into the aire,   [daj200]
 As milde and gentle as the new borne babe,
 That dies with mothers dugge betweene his lips,
 Where from thy sight I should be raging madde,   [daj203]
 And call for thee to close mine eyes,
 Or with thy lips to stop my dying soule,   ·daj205·
 That _I_ might breathe it so into thy bodie,
 And then it liu’d in sweete Elyziam,
 By thee to die, were but to die in ieast,
 From thee to die, were torment more then death,
 O let me staie, befall, what may befall.   ·daj210·

 _Queen._ Oh mightst thou staie with safetie of thy life,
 Then shouldst thou staie, but heauens deny it,
 And therefore go, but hope ere longe to be repelde.

 _Suff._ _I_ goe.

 _Queene._ And take my heart with thee.   ·daj215·
    She kisseth him.

 _Suff._ A iewell lockt into the wofulst caske,
 That euer yet containde a thing of woorth,
 Thus like a splitted barke so sunder we.

 _Queene._ This way for me.      _Exet Queene._


SCENE XI.

Enter King and _Salsbury_, and then the Curtaines be drawne, and the
Cardinall is discouered in his bed, rauing and staring as if he were
madde.

 _Car._ Oh death, if thou wilt let me liue but one whole yeare,
 Ile giue thee as much gold as will purchase such another Iland.

 _King._ Oh see my Lord of Salsbury how he is troubled,
 Lord Cardinall, remember Christ must saue thy soule.   [dak004]

 _Car._ Why died he not in his bed?   ·dak005·
 What would you haue me to do then?
 Can I make men liue whether they will or no?
 Sirra, go fetch me the strong poison which the Pothicary sent
               me.   [dak008]
 Oh see where Duke Humphreys ghoast doth stand,
 And stares me in the face. Looke, looke, coame downe his
               haire,   [dak010]
 So now hees gone againe: Oh, oh, oh.   [dak011]

 _Sal._ See how the panges of death doth gripe his heart.

 _King._ Lord Cardinall, if thou diest assured of heauenly blisse,
 Hold vp thy hand and make some signe to vs.
               The Cardinall dies.

 Oh see he dies, and makes no signe at all.   ·dak015·
 Oh God forgiue his soule.

 _Salb._ So bad an ende did neuer none behold,
 But as his death, so was his life in all.

 _King._ Forbeare to iudge, good Salsbury forbeare,
 For God will iudge vs all.   ·dak020·
 Go take him hence, and see his funerals be performde.   [dak021]

 And let them paie their ransomes ere they passe.   [dal006]

 _Water._ How now, what doest thou feare me?   [dal008]
 Thou shalt haue better cause anon.

 _Suf._  It is thy name affrights me, not thy selfe.
 I do remember well, a cunning Wyssard told me,
 That by Water I should die:
 Yet let not that make thee bloudie minded.
 Thy name being rightly sounded,
 Is Gualter, not Water.   ·dal015·

 _Water._  Gualter or Water, als one to me,   [dal016]
 I am the man must bring thee to thy death.

 _Suf._  I am a Gentleman looke on my Ring,
 Ransome me at what thou wilt, it shalbe paid.   [dal019]

 _Water._  I lost mine eye in boording of the ship,   ·dal020·
 And therefore ere I marchantlike sell blood for gold,
 Then cast me headlong downe into the sea.

 _Cap._ I but Ioue was neuer slaine as thou shalt be.

 _Suf._ Base Iadie groome, King Henries blood
    The honourable blood of Lancaster,   ·dal035·
 Cannot be shead by such a lowly swaine,

 _Cap._ Ile waffe thee to thy death, go Water take him hence,
 And on our long boates side, chop off his head.   ·dal040·

 _Suf._ Thou darste not for thine owne.

 _Cap._ Yes Poull.

 _Suffolke._ Poull.

 _Cap._ I Poull, puddle, kennell, sinke and durt,

 Those lips of thine that so oft haue kist the   [dal046]
 Queene, shall sweepe the ground, and thou that
 Smildste at good Duke Humphreys death,
 Shalt liue no longer to infect the earth.

 _Suffolke._ This villain being but Captain of a Pinnais,   [dal050]
 Threatens more plagues then mightie Abradas,
 The great Masadonian Pyrate,   [dal052]
 Thy words addes fury and not remorse in me.

 _Cap._ I but my deeds shall staie thy fury soone.

 _Suffolke._ Hast not thou waited at my Trencher,   ·dal055·
 When we haue feasted with Queene Margret?   [dal056]
 Hast not thou kist thy hand and held my stirrope?   [dal057]
 And barehead plodded by my footecloth Mule,
 And thought thee happie when I smilde on thee?
 This hand hath writ in thy defence,   ·dal060·
 Then shall I charme thee, hold thy lauish toong.

 _Cap._ Away with him, Water, I say, and off with his hed.   [dal062]

 1. _Priso._ Good my Lord, intreat him mildly for your life.

 _Suffolke._ First let this necke stoupe to the axes edge,
 Before this knee do bow to any,   ·dal065·
 Saue to the God of heauen and to my King:
 Suffolkes imperiall toong cannot pleade
 To such a Iadie groome.

 _Water._ Come, come, why do we let him speake,   [dal069]
 I long to haue his head for raunsome of mine eye.   ·dal070·

 _Suffolke._ A Swordar and bandeto slaue,   [dal071]
 Murthered sweete Tully.
 Brutus bastard-hand stabde Iulius Cæsar,   [dal073]
 And Suffolke dies by Pyrates on the seas.   [dal074]
               _Exet Suffolke_ and _Water_.

 _Cap._ Off with his head, and send it to the Queene,   ·dal075·

 But sirrha George whats the matter?   [dam005]

 _George._ Why sirrha, Iack Cade the Diar of Ashford here,
 He meanes to turne this land, and set a new nap on it.   [dam007]

 _Nick._ I marry he had need so, for tis growne threedbare,   [dam008]
 Twas neuer merry world with vs, since these gentle men came
               vp.   [dam009]

 _George._ I warrant thee, thou shalt neuer see a Lord weare a  ·dam010·
 leather aperne now a-daies.

 _Nick._ But sirrha, who comes more beside Iacke Cade?   [dam012]

 _George._ Why theres Dicke the Butcher, and Robin the Sadler, [dam013]

 Tom, and Gregory that should haue your Parnill, and a great ·dam015·
 sort more is come from Rochester, and from Maydstone, and Canterbury,

    Enter _Iacke Cade_, _Dicke Butcher_, _Robin_, _Will_, _Tom_,
    _Harry_ and the rest, with long staues.

 _Cade._ Proclaime silence.   ·dam020·

 _All._ Silence.

 _Cade._ I Iohn Cade so named for my valiancie.

 _Dicke._ Or rather for stealing of a Cade of Sprats.

 _Cade._ My father was a Mortemer.   [dam024]

 _Nicke._ He was an honest man and a good Brick-laier.   [dam025]

 _Cade._ My mother came of the Brases.   [dam026]

               lases.   [dam027]

 She washeth buckes vp and down the country.

 _Cade._ Therefore I am honourably borne.   [dam030]

 _Harry._ I for the field is honourable, for he was borne   [dam031]
 Vnder a hedge, for his father had no house but the Cage.   [dam032]

 _Cade._ I am able to endure much.

 _George._ Thats true, I know he can endure any thing,   [dam034]
 For I haue seen him whipt two market daies togither.   ·dam035·

 _Cade._ I feare neither sword nor fire.

 _Will._ He need not feare the sword, for his coate is of proofe.

 _Dicke._ But mee thinkes he should feare the fire, being so often
 burnt in the hand, for stealing of sheepe.

 _Cade._ Therefore be braue, for your Captain is braue, and vowes
 ·dam040· reformation: you shall haue seuen half-penny loaues for a
 penny, and the three hoopt pot, shall haue ten hoopes, and it shall

 _Cade._ I thanke you good people, you shall all eate and drinke
 of ·dam045· my score, and go all in my liuerie, and weele haue no
 writing, but [dam046] the score & the Tally, and there shalbe no lawes
 but such as comes [dam047] from my mouth.

 _Dicke._ We shall haue sore lawes then, for he was thrust into the
 mouth the other day.   ·dam050·

 _George._ I and stinking law too, for his breath stinks so, that one
 [dam051] cannot abide it.

    Enter _Will_ with the Clarke of _Chattam_.

 _Will._ Oh Captaine a pryze.

 _Cade._ Whose that Will?   [dam054]

 _Will._ The Clarke of _Chattam,_ he can write and reade and cast

 _Dicke._ It will go hard with you, I can tell you,   [dam061]
 For they vse to write that oth top of letters.   [dam062]

 _Cade._ And what do you vse to write your name?   [dam063]
 Or do you as auncient forefathers haue done,

 _Clarke._ Nay, true sir, I praise God I haue been so well brought

 brother are comming with the kings power, and mean to kill vs all.
 [dam071]

 _Cade._ Let them come, hees but a knight is he?   [dam072]

 _Tom._ No, no, hees but a knight.

 _Cade._ Why then to equall him, ile make my selfe knight.
 Kneele downe Iohn Mortemer,   ·dam075·
 Rise vp sir Iohn Mortemer.
 Is there any more of them that be Knights?

 _Tom._ I his brother.   [dam078]

    He Knights _Dicke Butcher._

 _Cade._ Then kneele downe Dicke Butcher,

               Now sound vp the Drumme.

    Enter sir _Humphrey Stafford_ and his brother, with Drumme and
    souldiers.

 _Cade._ As for these silken coated slaues I passe not a pinne,
 Tis to you good people that I speake.

 _Stafford._ Why country-men, what meane you thus in troopes,
 To follow this rebellious Traitor Cade?
 Why his father was but a Brick-laier.   [dam085]

 _Cade._ Well, and Adam was a Gardner, what then?   [dam086]
 But I come of the Mortemers.

 _Stafford._ I, the Duke of Yorke hath taught you that.

 _Cade._ The Duke of York, nay, I learnt it my selfe,
 For looke you, Roger Mortemer the Earle of March,   ·dam090·
 Married the Duke of Clarence daughter.

 _Stafford._ Well, thats true: But what then?   [dam092]

 _Cade._ And by her he had two children at a birth.

 _Stafford._ Thats false.   [dam094]

 _Cade._ I, but I say, tis true.   ·dam095·

 _All._ Why then tis true.

 _Cade._ And one of them was stolne away by a begger-woman,
 And that was my father, and I am his sonne,   [dam098]
 Deny it and you can.

 _Nicke._ Nay looke you, I know twas true,   [dam100]
 For his father built a chimney in my fathers house,
 And the brickes are aliue at this day to testifie.   [dam102]

 _Cade._ But doest thou heare Stafford, tell the King, that for his
 fathers sake, in whose time boyes plaide at spanne-counter with
 Frenche Crownes, I am content that hee shall be King as long ·dam105·
 as he liues. Marry alwaies prouided, ile be Protector ouer him.
 [dam106]

 _Stafford._ O monstrous simplicitie.   [dam107]

 _Cade._ And tell him, weele haue the Lorde Sayes head, and the
 [dam108] Duke of Somersets, for deliuering vp the Dukedomes of Anioy
 and Mayne, and selling the Townes in France, by which meanes ·dam110·
 England hath bene maimde euer since, and gone as it were with a
 [dam111] crouch, but that my puissance held it vp. And besides, they
 can [dam112] speake French, and therefore they are traitors.

 _Stafford._ As how I prethie?

 _Cade._ Why the French men are our enemies be they not?   ·dam115·
 And then can hee that speakes with the tongue of an enemy be a
 good subject?

 Answere me to that.

 _Stafford._ Well sirrha, wilt thou yeeld thy selfe vnto the Kings
 mercy, and he will pardon thee and these, their outrages and
 rebellious [dam120] deeds?

 _Cade._ Nay, bid the King come to me and he will, and then ile pardon
 him, or otherwaies ile haue his Crowne tell him, ere it be long.

 _Stafford._ Go Herald, proclaime in all the Kings Townes,   ·dam125·
 That those that will forsake the Rebell Cade,
 Shall haue free pardon from his Maiestie.
               _Exet Stafford_ and his men.

 Calling your grace an vsurper,
 And that monstrous Rebell Cade, hath sworne   ·dao015·
 To Crowne himselfe King in Westminster,
 Therefore flie my Lord, and poste to Killingworth.

 _King._ Go bid Buckingham and Clifford, gather
 An Army vp, and meete with the Rebels.
 Come Madame, let vs haste to Killingworth.   ·dao020·
 Come on Lord Say, go thou along with vs,
 For feare the Rebell Cade do finde thee out.

 And therfore with your highnesse leaue, ile staie behind.

 For they haue wonne the bridge,
 Killing all those that withstand them.
 The Lord Mayor craueth ayde of your honor from the Tower,   ·dap005·
 To defend the Citie from the Rebels.

 _Lord Scayles._ Such aide as I can spare, you shall command,
 But I am troubled here with them my selfe,
 The Rebels haue attempted to win the Tower,
 But get you to Smythfield and gather head,   ·dap010·
 And thither I will send you Mathew Goffe,   [dap011]
 Fight for your King, your Country, and your liues,
 And so farewell, for I must hence againe.   [dap013]
               _Exet omnes._

 For any that calles me any otherwise then   [daq006]

 _Cade._ _Be_ it a Lordship Dicke, and thou shalt haue it
 For that word.   ·dar005·

 _Dicke._  That we may go burne all the Records,
 And that all writing may be put downe,
 And nothing vsde but the score and the Tally.

 _Cade._ Dicke it shall be so, and henceforward all things shall be
 [dar009] in common, and in Cheapeside shall my palphrey go to grasse.
 ·dar010· Why ist not a miserable thing, that of the skin of an
 innocent lamb should parchment be made, & then with a litle blotting
 ouer with [dar012] inke, a man should vndo himselfe.

 Some saies tis the bees that sting, but I say, tis their waxe, for

 ·dar015· owne man since.

 _Nicke._ But when shall we take vp those commodities
 Which you told vs of.

 What answere canst thou make vnto my mightinesse,   ·dar025·

 For deliuering vp the townes in France to Mounsier bus mine cue, the
 Dolphin of France?

 And more then so, thou hast most traitorously erected a grammer
 schoole, to infect the youth of the realme, and against the Kings
 Crowne and dignitie, thou hast built vp a paper-mill, nay it wil be
 ·dar030· said to thy face, that thou kepst men in thy house that daily
 reades [dar031] of bookes with red letters, and talkes of a Nowne and
 a Verbe, and such abhominable words as no Christian eare is able to
 endure it. [dar033] And besides all that, thou hast appointed certaine
 Iustises of peace [dar034] in euery shire to hang honest men that
 steale for their liuing, and ·dar035· because they could not reade,
 thou hast hung them vp: Onely for which cause they were most worthy to
 liue. Thou ridest on a foot-cloth [dar037] doest thou not?

 _Say._ Yes, what of that?

 _Cade._ Marry I say, thou oughtest not to let thy horse weare a
 ·dar040· cloake, when an honester man then thy selfe, goes in his hose
 and doublet.

 _Say._ You men of Kent.

 _All._ Kent, what of Kent?

 _Say._ Nothing but _bona, terra_.   [dar045]

 _Cade._ _Bonum terum_, sounds whats that?   [dar046]

 _Dicke._ He speakes French.

 _Will._ No tis Dutch.

 _Dicke._ No tis outtalian, I know it well inough.   [dar049]

 _Say._ Kent, in the Commentaries Cæsar wrote,   ·dar050·
 Termde it the ciuel’st place of all this land,
 Then noble Country-men, heare me but speake,
 I sold not France, I lost not Normandie.   [dar053]

 _Cade._ But wherefore doest thou shake thy head so?

 _Say._ It is the palsie and not feare that makes me.   ·dar055·

 _Cade._ Nay thou nodst thy head, as who say, thou wilt be euen
 [dar056] with me, if thou getst away, but ile make the sure inough,
 now I [dar057] haue thee. Go take him to the standerd in Cheapeside
 and chop of [dar058] his head, and then go to milende-greene, to sir
 Iames Cromer his sonne in law, and cut off his head too, and bring
 them to me vpon ·dar060· two poles presently. (Away with him.
               _Exet_ one or two, with the Lord _Say_.

 There shall not a noble man weare a head on his shoulders,
 But he shall paie me tribute for it.
 Nor there shal not a mayd be married, but he shal fee to me for her.
 Maydenhead or else, ile haue it my selfe,   ·dar065·
 Marry I will that married men shall hold of me in capitie,   [dar066]
 And that their wiues shalbe as free as hart can thinke, or toong
               can (tell.

 _Sargiant._ Iustice, iustice, I pray you sir, let me haue iustice of
 this fellow here.

 _Cade._ Why what has he done?

 _Sarg._ Alasse sir he has rauisht my wife.

 _Dicke._ Why my Lord he would haue rested me,   ·dar075·
 And I went and and entred my Action in his wiues paper house.  [dar076]

 _Cade._ Dicke follow thy sute in her common place,
 You horson villaine, you are a Sargiant youle,   [dar078]
 Take any man by the throate for twelue pence,
 And rest a man when hees at dinner,   [dar080]
 And haue him to prison ere the meate be out of his mouth.   [dar081]
 Go Dicke take him hence, cut out his toong for cogging,   [dar082]
 Hough him for running, and to conclude,
 Braue him with his owne mace.   [dar084]
               _Exet_ with the Sargiant.

    Enter two with the Lord _Sayes_ head, and sir Iames Cromers, vpon

 So, come carry them before me, and at euery lanes ende, let them

    Enter the Duke of _Buckingham_, and Lord _Clifford_ the Earle of
    _Comberland_.

 _Clifford._ Why country-men and warlike friends of Kent,
 What meanes this mutinous rebellions,   [dar088]
 That you in troopes do muster thus your selues,
 Vnder the conduct of this Traitor Cade?   ·dar090·
 To rise against your soueraigne Lord and King,
 Who mildly hath his pardon sent to you,
 If you forsake this monstrous Rebell here?
 If honour be the marke whereat you aime,
 Then haste to France that our forefathers wonne,   ·dar095·
 And winne againe that thing which now is lost,
 And leaue to seeke your Countries ouerthrow.

 _All._ A Clifford, a Clifford.
               They forsake Cade.

 _Cade._ Why how now, will you forsake your generall,
 And ancient freedome which you haue possest?   ·dar100·
 To bend your neckes vnder their seruile yokes,   [dar101]
 Who if you stir, will straightwaies hang you vp,   [dar102]
 But follow me, and you shall pull them downe,
 And make them yeeld their liuings to your hands.

 _All._ A Cade, a Cade.   ·dar105·
               They runne to _Cade_ againe.

 _Cliff._ Braue warlike friends heare me but speak a word,   [dar106]
 Refuse not good whilst it is offered you,
 The King is mercifull, then yeeld to him,
 And I my selfe will go along with you,
 To Winsore Castle whereas the King abides,   ·dar110·
 And on mine honour you shall haue no hurt.

 _All._ A Clifford, a Clifford, God saue the King.

 _Cade._ How like a feather is this rascall company
 Blowne euery way,   [dar114]
 But that they may see there want no valiancy in me,   [dar115]
 My staffe shall make way through the midst of you,
 And so a poxe take you all.   [dar117]
               He runs through them with his staffe, and flies away.

 _Buc._ Go some and make after him, and proclaime,
 That those that can bring the head of Cade,
 Shall haue a thousand Crownes for his labour.   ·dar120·
 Come march away.       _Exet omnes._   [dar121]


SCENE XIX.

Enter King _Henry_ and the Queene, and _Somerset_.

 _King._ Lord Somerset, what newes here you of the Rebell
               Cade?   [das001]

 _Som._ This, my gratious Lord, that the Lord Say is don to death,
 And the Citie is almost sackt.

 _King._ Gods will be done, for as he hath decreede, so must it
               be:   [das004]
 And be it as he please, to stop the pride of those rebellious
               men.   [das005]

 _Queene._ Had the noble Duke of Suffolke bene aliue,
 The Rebell Cade had bene supprest ere this,
 And all the rest that do take part with him.

    Enter the Duke of _Buckingham_ and _Clifford_, with the Rebels,
    with halters about their necks.

 _Cliff._ Long liue King Henry, Englands lawfull King,
 Loe here my Lord, these Rebels are subdude,   ·das010·
 And offer their liues before your highnesse feete.

 _King._ But tell me Clifford, is there Captaine here.   [das012]

 _Clif._ No, my gratious Lord, he is fled away, but proclamations are
 sent forth, that he that can but bring his head, shall haue a thousand
 crownes. But may it please your Maiestie, to pardon these ·das015·
 their faults, that by that traitors meanes were thus misled. [das016]

 _King._ Stand vp you simple men, and giue God praise,
 For you did take in hand you know not what,
 And go in peace obedient to your King,
 And liue as subiects, and you shall not want,   ·das020·
 Whilst Henry liues, and weares the English Crowne.

 _All._ God saue the King, God saue the King.

 _King._ Come let vs hast to London now with speed,
 That solemne prosessions may be sung,   [das024]
 In laud and honour of the God of heauen,   ·das025·
 And triumphs of this happie victorie.   (_Exet omnes._   [das026]


SCENE XX.

Enter _Iacke Cade_ at one doore, and at the other, maister _Alexander
Eyden_ and his men, and _Iack Cade_ lies downe picking of hearbes and
eating them.

 _Eyden._ Good Lord how pleasant is this country life,   [dat001]
 This litle land my father left me here,
 With my contented minde serues me as well,
 As all the pleasures in the Court can yeeld,
 Nor would I change this pleasure for the Court.   ·dat005·

 _Cade._ Sounes, heres the Lord of the soyle, Stand villaine, thou
 [dat006] wilt betraie mee to the King, and get a thousand crownes for
 my head, but ere thou goest, ile make thee eate yron like an Astridge,
 [dat008] and swallow my sword like a great pinne.

 _Eyden._ Why sawcy companion, why should I betray thee?   ·dat010·
 Ist not inough that thou hast broke my hedges,
 And enterd into my ground without the leaue of me the owner,   [dat012]
 But thou wilt braue me too.

 _Cade._ Braue thee and beard thee too, by the best blood of the
 [dat014] Realme, looke on me well, I haue eate no meate this fine
 dayes, yet ·dat015· and I do not leaue thee and thy fine men as dead
 as a doore nayle, I [dat016] pray God I may neuer eate grasse more.

 _Eyden._ Nay, it neuer shall be saide whilst the world doth stand,
 [dat018] that Alexander Eyden an Esquire of Kent, tooke oddes to
 combat with a famisht man, looke on me, my limmes are equall vnto
 thine, ·dat020· and euery way as big, then hand to hand, ile combat
 thee. Sirrha [dat021] fetch me weopons, and stand you all aside.
 [dat022]

 _Cade._ Now sword, if thou doest not hew this burly-bond churle
 [dat023] into chines of beefe, I beseech God thou maist fal into some
 smiths [dat024] hand, and be turnd to hob-nailes. [dat025]

 _Eyden._ Come on thy way.         (They fight, and _Cade_ fals downe.

 _Cade._ Oh villaine, thou hast slaine the floure of Kent for
 chiualrie, but it is famine & not thee that has done it, for come ten
 thousand diuels, and giue me but the ten meales that I wanted this
 fiue daies, and ile fight with you all, and so a poxe rot thee, for
 Iack Cade must die.   (He dies.

 _Eyden._ Iack Cade, & was it that monstrous Rebell which I haue
 [dat032] slaine. Oh sword ile honour thee for this, and in my chamber
 shalt [dat033] thou hang as a monument to after age, for this great
 seruice thou hast done to me. He drag him hence, and with my sword cut
 off his [dat035] head, and beare it   _Exet._   [dat036]


SCENE XXI.

Enter the Duke of _Yorke_ with Drum and souldiers.

 _Yorke._ In Armes from Ireland comes Yorke amaine,
 Ring belles aloud, bonfires perfume the ayre,
 To entertaine faire Englands royall King.
 Ah _Sancta Maiesta_, who would not buy thee deare?

    Enter the Duke of _Buckingham_.

 But soft, who comes here _Buckingham_, what newes with him?   [dau005]

 _Buc._ Yorke, if thou meane well, I greete thee so.

 _Yorke._ Humphrey of Buckingham, welcome I sweare:
 What comes thou in loue or as a Messenger?   [dau008]

 _Buc._ I come as a Messenger from our dread Lord and soueraign,
 Henry. To know the reason of these Armes in peace?   ·dau010·
 Or that thou being a subiect as I am,
 Shouldst thus approach so neare with colours spred,
 Whereas the person of the King doth keepe?

 _Yorke._ A subiect as he is.   [dau014]
 Oh how I hate these spitefull abiect termes,   ·dau015·
 But Yorke dissemble, till thou meete thy sonnes,
 Who now in Armes expect their fathers sight,
 And not farre hence I know they cannot be.   [dau018]
 Humphrey Duke of Buckingham, pardon me,
 That I answearde not at first, my mind was troubled,   ·dau020·
 I came to remoue that monstrous Rebell Cade,
 And heaue proud Somerset from out the Court,
 That basely yeelded vp the Townes in France.

 _Buc._ Why that was presumption on thy behalfe,
 But if it be no otherwise but so,   [dau025]
 The King doth pardon thee, and granst to thy request,   [dau026]
 And Somerset is sent vnto the Tower.

 _Yorke._ Vpon thine honour is it so?

 _Buc._ Yorke, he is vpon mine honour.

 _York._ Then before thy face, I here dismisse my troopes,   ·dau030·
 Sirs, meete me to morrow in saint Georges fields,
 And there you shall receiue your paie of me.   [dau032]

    _Exet_ souldiers.

 _Buc._ Come York, thou shalt go speake vnto the King,
 But see, his grace is comming to meete with vs.

    Enter King _Henry_.

 _King._ How now Buckingham, is Yorke friends with vs,   ·dau035·
 That thus thou bringst him hand in hand with thee?

 _Buc._ He is my Lord, and hath dischargde his troopes
 Which came with him, but as your grace did say,
 To heaue the Duke of Somerset from hence,
 And to subdue the Rebels that were vp.   ·dau040·

 _King._ Then welcome cousin Yorke, giue me thy hand,
 And thankes for thy great seruice done to vs,
 Against those traitorous Irish that rebeld.

    Enter maister _Eyden_ with _Iacke Cades_ head.

 _Eyden._ Long liue Henry in triumphant peace,   [dau044]
 Lo here my Lord vpon my bended knees,   ·dau045·
 I here present the traitorous head of Cade,
 That hand to hand in single fight I slue.

 _King._ First thanks to heauen, & next to thee my friend,
 That hast subdude that wicked traitor thus.
 O let me see that head that in his life,   ·dau050·
 Did worke me and my land such cruell spight,
 A visage sterne, cole blacke his curled locks,
 Deepe trenched furrowes in his frowning brow,
 Presageth warlike humors in his life.
 Here take it hence and thou for thy reward,   ·dau055·
 Shalt be immediatly created Knight.
 Kneele downe my friend, and tell me whats thy name?   [dau057]

 _Eyden._ Alexander Eyden, if it please your grace,
 A poore Esquire of Kent.

 _King._ Then rise vp sir Alexander Eyden knight,   [dau060]
 And for thy maintenance, I freely giue
 A thousand markes a yeare to maintaine thee,   [dau062]
 Beside the firme reward that was proclaimde,
 For those that could performe this worthie act,
 And thou shalt waight vpon the person of the king.   [dau065]

 _Eyden._ I humbly thank your grace, and I no longer liue,
 Then I proue iust and loyall to my king.      (_Exet._   [dau067]

    Enter the Queene with the Duke of _Somerset_.

 _King._ O Buckingham see where Somerset comes,
 Bid him go hide himselfe till Yorke be gone.

 _Queene._ He shall not hide himselfe for feare of Yorke,   ·dau070·
 But beard and braue him proudly to his face.

 _Yorke._ Whose that, proud Somerset at libertie?   [dau072]
 Base fearefull Henry that thus dishonor’st me,
 By heauen, thou shalt not gouerne ouer me:
 I cannot brooke that Traitors presence here,   ·dau075·
 Nor will I subiect be to such a King,
 That knowes not how to gouerne nor to rule,
 Resigne thy Crowne proud Lancaster to me,
 That thou vsurped hast so long by force,
 For now is Yorke resolu’d to claim his owne,   ·dau080·
 And rise aloft into faire Englands Throane.

 _Somer._ Proud Traitor, I arest thee on high treason,
 Against thy soueraigne Lord, yeeld thee false Yorke,
 For here I sweare, thou shalt vnto the Tower,
 For these proud words which thou hast giuen the king.   ·dau085·

 _Yorke._ Thou art deceiued, my sonnes shalbe my baile,   [dau086]
 And send thee there in dispight of him.   [dau087]
 Hoe, where are you boyes?

 _Queene._ Call Clifford hither presently.


SCENE XXII.

Enter the Duke of _Yorkes_ sonnes, _Edward_ the Earle of _March_, and
crook-backe _Richard_, at the one doore, with Drumme and soldiers, and
at the other doore, enter _Clifford_ and his sonne, with Drumme and
souldiers, and _Clifford_ kneeles to _Henry_, and speakes.

 _Cliff._ Long liue my noble Lord, and soueraigne King.

 _Yorke._ We thank thee Clifford.
 Nay, do not affright vs with thy lookes,
 If thou didst mistake, we pardon thee, kneele againe.

 _Cliff._ Why, I did no way mistake, this is my King.   ·dav005·
 What is he mad? to Bedlam with him.

 _King._ I, a bedlam frantike humor driues him thus   [dav007]
 To leauy Armes against his lawfull King.   [dav008]

 _Clif._ Why doth not your grace send him to the Tower?   [dav009]

 _Queene._ He is arested, but will not obey,   ·dav010·
 His sonnes he saith, shall be his baile.   [dav011]

 _Yorke._ How say you boyes, will you not?

 _Edward._ Yes noble father, if our words will serue.

 _Richard._ And if our words will not, our swords shall.

 _Yorke._ Call hither to the stake, my two rough beares.   ·dav015·

 _King._ Call Buckingham, and bid him Arme himselfe.

 _Yorke._ Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast,
 Both thou and they, shall curse this fatall houre.   [dav018]

    Enter at one doore, the Earles of _Salsbury_ and _Warwicke_, with
    Drumme and souldiers. And at the other, the Duke of _Buckingham_,
    with Drumme and souldiers.

 _Cliff._ Are these thy beares? weele bayte them soone,
 Dispight of thee, and all the friends thou hast. ·dav20·

 _War._ You had best go dreame againe,
 To keepe you from the tempest of the field.

 _Clif._ I am resolu’d to beare a greater storme,
 Then any thou canst coniure vp to day,
 And that ile write vpon thy Burgonet,   ·dav025·
 Might I but know thee by thy houshold badge.

 _War._ Now by my fathers age, old Neuels crest,
 The Rampant Beare chaind to the ragged staffe,
 This day ile weare aloft my burgonet,
 As on a mountaine top the Cædar showes,   ·dav030·
 That keepes his leaues in spight of any storme,
 Euen to affright the with the view thereof.   [dav032]

 _Clif._ And from thy burgonet will I rend the beare,
 And tread him vnderfoote with all contempt,
 Dispight the Beare-ward that protects him so.   ·dav035·

 _Yoong Clif._ And so renowmed soueraigne to Armes,   [dav036]
 To quell these Traitors and their compleases.   [dav037]

 _Richard._ Fie, Charitie for shame, speake it not in spight,
 For you shall sup with Iesus Christ to night.

 _Yoong Clif._ Foule Stigmaticke thou canst not tell.   ·dav040·

 _Rich._ No, for if not in heauen, youle surely sup in hell.   [dav041]
               _Exet omnes._


SCENE XXIII.

Alarmes to the battaile, and then enter the Duke of _Somerset_ and
_Richard_ fighting, and _Richard_ kils him vnder the signe of the
Castle in saint _Albones_.

 _Rich._ So Lie thou there, and breathe thy last.   [daw001]
 Whats here, the signe of the Castle?   [daw002]
 Then the prophesie is come to passe,
 For Somerset was forewarned of Castles,
 The which he alwaies did obserue.   ·daw005·
 And now behold, vnder a paltry Ale-house signe,
 The Castle in saint Albones,   [daw007]
 Somerset hath made the Wissard famous by his death.   [daw008]
               _Exet._

    Alarme again, and enter the Earle of _Warwicke_ alone.

 _War._ Clifford of Comberland, tis Warwicke calles,
 And if thou doest not hide thee from the Beare,   ·daw010·
 Now whilst the angry Trompets sound Alarmes,
 And dead mens cries do fill the emptie aire:
 Clifford I say, come forth and fight with me,
 Proud Northerne Lord, Clifford of Comberland,
 Warwicke is hoarse with calling thee to Armes.   ·daw015·
               Clifford speakes within.

 Warwicke stand still, and view the way that Clifford hewes with
 his murthering Curtel-axe, through the fainting troopes to finde
 thee out.

 Warwicke stand still, and stir not till I come.

    Enter _Yorke_.

 _War._ How now my Lord, what a foote?   ·daw020·
 Who kild your horse?

 _Yorke._ The deadly hand of Clifford. Noble Lord,
 Fiue horse this day slaine vnder me,
 And yet braue Warwicke I remaine aliue,
 But I did kill his horse he lou’d so well,   ·daw025·
 The boniest gray that ere was bred in North.

    Enter _Clifford_, and _Warwicke_ offers to fight with him.

 Hold Warwicke, and seeke thee out some other chase,
 My selfe will hunt this deare to death.

 _War._ Braue Lord, tis for a Crowne thou fights,   [daw029]
 Clifford farewell, as I entend to prosper well to day,   ·daw030·
 It grieues my soule to leaue thee vnassaild.
               _Exet Warwicke._

 _Yorke._ Now Clifford, since we are singled here alone,
 Be this the day of doome to one of vs,
 For now my heart hath sworne immortall hate
 To thee, and all the house of Lancaster.   ·daw035·

 _Cliffood._ And here I stand, and pitch my foot to thine,
 Vowing neuer to stir, till thou or I be slaine.
 For neuer shall my heart be safe at rest,
 Till I haue spoyld the hatefull house of Yorke.
               Alarmes, and they fight, and _Yorke_ kils _Clifford_.

 _Yorke._ Now Lancaster sit sure, thy sinowes shrinke,   [daw040]
 Come fearefull Henry grouelling on thy face,
 Yeeld vp thy Crowne vnto the Prince of Yorke.
               _Exet Yorke._

    Alarmes, then enter yoong _Clifford_ alone.

 _Yoong Clifford._ Father of Comberland,
 Where may I seeke my aged father forth?   [daw044]
 O! dismall sight, see where he breathlesse lies,   [daw045]
 All smeard and weltred in his luke-warme blood,
 Ah, aged pillar of all Comberlands true house,
 Sweete father, to thy murthred ghoast I sweare,
 Immortall hate vnto the house of Yorke,
 Nor neuer shall I sleepe secure one night,
 Till I haue furiously reuengde thy death,
 And left not one of them to breath on earth.

    He takes him vp on his backe.

 And thus as old Ankyses sonne did beare
 His aged father on his manly backe,
 And fought with him against the bloodie Greeks,   ·daw055·
 Euen so will I. But staie, heres one of them,   [daw056]
 To whom my soule hath sworne immortall hate.   [daw057]

    Enter _Richard_, and then _Clifford_ laies downe his father, fights
    with him, and _Richard_ flies away againe.

 Out crooktbacke villaine, get thee from my sight.   [daw058]
 But I will after thee, and once againe
 When I haue borne my father to his Tent,   ·daw060·
 Ile trie my fortune better with thee yet.   [daw061]
               _Exet_ yoong _Clifford_ with his father.

    Alarmes againe, and then enter three or foure, bearing the Duke of
    _Buckingham_ wounded to his Tent.

    Alarmes still, and then enter the King and Queene.

 _Queene._ Away my Lord, and flie to London straight,
 Make hast, for vengeance comes along with them,
 Come stand not to expostulate, lets go.   [daw064]

 _King._ Come then faire Queene, to London let vs hast,   ·daw065·
 And sommon a Parlament with speede,   [daw066]
 To stop the fury of these dyre euents.   [daw067]
               _Exet_ King and Queene.

    Alarmes, and then a flourish, and enter the Duke of _Yorke_ and
    _Richard_.

 _Yorke._ How now boyes, fortunate this fight hath bene,
 I hope to vs and ours, for Englands good,
 And our great honour, that so long we lost,   ·daw070·
 Whilst faint-heart Henry did vsurpe our rights:
 But did you see old Salsbury, since we
 With bloodie mindes did buckle with the foe,
 I would not for the losse of this right hand,
 That ought but well betide that good old man.   ·daw075·

 _Rich._ My Lord, I saw him in the thickest throng,
 Charging his Lance with his old weary armes,
 And thrise I saw him beaten from his horse,
 And thrise this hand did set him vp againe,
 And still he fought with courage gainst his foes,   ·daw080·
 The boldest sprited man that ere mine eyes beheld.   [daw081]

    Enter _Salsbbury_ and _Warwicke_.

 _Edward._ See noble father, where they both do come,
 The onely props vnto the house of Yorke.

 _Sals._ Well hast thou fought this day, thou valiant Duke,
 And thou braue bud of Yorkes encreasing house,   ·daw085·
 The small remainder of my weary life,
 I hold for thee, for with thy warlike arme,
 Three times this day thou hast preseru’d my life.

 _Yorke._ What say you Lords, the King is fled to London?
 There as I here to hold a Parlament.   [daw090]
 What saies Lord Warwicke, shall we after them?

 _War._  After them, nay before them if we can.
 Now by my faith Lords, twas a glorious day,   [daw093]
 Saint Albones battaile wonne by famous Yorke,
 Shall be eternest in all age to come.   [daw095]
 Sound Drummes and Trumpets, and to London all,
 And more such daies as these to vs befall.   [daw097]
               _Exet omnes._

NOTES TO THE FIRST PART OF THE CONTENTION, &c.


NOTE I.

I. 66. The Quarto of 1594 has ‘Exet’ throughout this play, which is
corrected in the edition of 1619 to ‘Exit,’ and in that of 1600 to
‘Exit’ or ‘exeunt.’ We have only recorded the corrections of ‘Exet’ to
‘Exeunt.’


NOTE II.

II. 45–47. Instead of these lines the Quarto of 1619 has:

 ‘As long as Gloster beares this base and humble minde:
  Were I a man, and Protector as he is,
  I’de reach to ’th Crowne, or make some hop headlesse.
  And being but a woman, ile not behinde
  For playing of my part, in spite of all that seek to crosse me thus:
  Who is within there?’


NOTE III.

VI. 11–27. In the edition of 1619 this passage is so much altered
that it is necessary to give it at full:

 ‘The second was _William_ of _Hatfield_,
  Who dyed young.
  The third was _Lyonell_, Duke of _Clarence_.
  The fourth was _Iohn of Gaunt_,
  The Duke of _Lancaster_.
  The fift was _Edmund of Langley_,
  Duke of Yorke.
  The sixt was _William of Windsore_,
  Who dyed young.
  The seauenth and last was Sir _Thomas of Woodstocke_, Duke of _Yorke_.

 Now _Edward_ the blacke Prince dyed before his Father, leauing behinde
 him two sonnes, _Edward_ borne at _Angolesme_, who died young, and
 _Richard_ that was after crowned King, by the name of _Richard_ the
 second, who dyed without an heyre.

 Lyonell Duke of Clarence dyed, and left him one only daughter, named
 _Phillip_, who was married to Edmund Mortimer earle of March and
 Vlster: and so by her I claime the Crowne, as the true heire to
 Lyonell Duke of Clarence, third sonne to Edward the third.’


NOTE IV.

XVIII. 37, 38. On the line ‘Thou ridest on a foot-cloth doest thou
not?’ Mr Halliwell remarks, ‘This passage, though completely necessary
for the sense, is entirely omitted in the edition of 1619 and by Mr
Knight.’ It is indeed omitted by Mr Knight, who follows Steevens, but
it is found in Capell’s copy of the edition of 1619, ‘Thou ridest on a
foot-cloth, dost thou not?’ We take this opportunity of remarking that,
in all cases where the readings given by us from the edition of 1619
differ from those quoted by Mr Halliwell, we have given them as they
stand in Capell’s copy. Mr Halliwell appears to quote from Mr Knight’s
reprint. Instances of these variations occur in Scene III. line 6,
where Steevens and Mr Knight print ‘They’ for ‘That,’ the reading of
all the Quartos: in Scene IV. line 41, where they have ‘treason’
for ‘treasons:’ in Scene VII. line 3, where they have ‘against’ for
‘gainst.’ In Scene X. line 76, Mr Halliwell says the edition of 1619
reads ‘with the vnbloody beake’: in Capell’s copy it is ‘With vnbloody
beake.’ In XX. 16 he quotes ‘Yet if I do not’ as the reading of the
edition of 1619 where Capell’s copy has ‘Yet if do not,’ the former
being the reading of Steevens’s reprint. In XX. 28 ‘hand’ is the
reading of all the Quartos, while Steevens has ‘hands.’ It is possible
that these variations may be found in other copies of the ed. of 1619.


NOTE V.

XX. 36. In the edition of 1594 the words which follow ‘beare it’ have
dropped out.




The true Tragedie of Richard Duke _of Yorke, and the good King_ Henry
the Sixt.

Enter _Richard_ Duke of _Yorke_, the Earle of _Warwicke_, _The Duke of
Norffolke_, _Marquis Montague_, _Edward Earl of March_, _Crookeback
Richard_, and the yong _Earle of Rutland_, with Drumme and Souldiers,
with white Roses in their hats.


SCENE I.

                              _Warwike._
 I wonder how the king escapt our hands.   [eaa001]

 _Yorke._ Whilst we pursude the horsemen of the North,
 He slilie stole awaie and left his men:
 Whereat the great Lord of Northumland,
 Whose warlike eares could neuer brooke retrait,   ·eaa005·
 Chargde our maine battels front, and therewith him   [eaa006]
 Lord _Stafford_ and Lord _Clifford_ all abrest
 Brake in and were by the hands of common Souldiers (slain.   [eaa008]

 _Edw._ Lord _Staffords_ father Duke of _Buckhingham_,
 Is either slaine or wounded dangerouslie,   [eaa010]
 I cleft his Beuer with a downe right blow:
 Father that this is true behold his bloud.

 _Mont._ And brother heeres the Earle of _Wiltshires_
 Bloud, whom I encountred as the battailes ioind.   [eaa014]

 _Rich._ Speake thou for me and tell them what I did.   ·eaa015·

 _York._ What is your grace dead my L. of _Summerset_?   [eaa016]

 _Norf._ Such hope haue all the line of _Iohn_ of _Gawnt_.

 _Rich._ Thus doe I hope to shape king _Henries_ head.

 _War._ And so do _I_ victorious prince of Yorke,
 Before I see thee seated in that throne   ·eaa020·
 Which now the house of _Lancaster_ vsurpes,
 I vow by heauens these eies shal neuer close.   [eaa022]
 This is the pallace of that fearefull king,
 And that the regall chaire? Possesse it Yorke:   [eaa024]
 For this is thine and not king _Henries_ heires.   ·eaa025·

 _York._ Assist me then sweet _Warwike_, and I wil:
 For hither are we broken in by force.

 _Norf._ Weele all assist thee, and he that flies shall die.

 _York._ Thanks gentle _Norffolke_. Staie by me my Lords,
 and souldiers staie you heere and lodge this night:   ·eaa030·

 _War._ And when the king comes offer him no
 Violence, vnlesse he seek to put vs out by force.   [eaa032]

 _Rich._ Armde as we be, lets staie within this house?   [eaa033]

 _War._ The bloudie parlement shall this be calde,
 Vnlesse _Plantagenet_ Duke of Yorke be king   ·eaa035·
 And bashfull _Henrie_ be deposde, whose cowardise
 Hath made vs by-words to our enemies.

 _York._ Then leaue me not my Lords: for now I meane
 To take possession of my right.

 _War._ Neither the king, nor him that loues him best,   ·eaa040·
 The proudest burd that holds vp _Lancaster_.   [eaa041]
 Dares stirre a wing if _Warwike_ shake his bels.   [eaa042]
 Ile plant _Plantagenet_: and root him out who dares?
 Resolue thee _Richard_: Claime the English crowne.

    Enter king _Henrie_ the sixt, with the Duke of _Excester_,
    The Earle of _Northumberland_, the Earle of _Westmerland_ and
    _Clifford_, the Earle of _Cumberland_ with red Roses in their hats.

 _King._ Looke Lordings where the sturdy rebel sits,   ·eaa045·
 Euen in the chaire of state: belike he meanes
 Backt by the power of _Warwike_ that false peere,
 To aspire vnto the crowne, and raigne as king.
 Earle of _Northumberland_, he slew thy father.
 And thine _Clifford_: and you both haue vow’d reuenge,   ·eaa050·
 On him, his sonnes, his fauorites, and his friends.

 _Northu._ And if I be not, heauens be reuengd on me.

 _Clif._ The hope thereof, makes _Clifford_ mourn in steel.

 _West._ What? shall we suffer this, lets pull him downe.   [eaa054]
 My hart for anger breakes, I cannot speake.   ·eaa055·

 _King._ Be patient gentle Earle of _Westmerland_.

 _Clif._ Patience is for pultrouns such as he
 He durst not sit there had your father liu’d?
 My gratious Lord: here in the Parlement,
 Let vs assaile the familie of Yorke.   ·eaa060·

 _North._ Well hast thou spoken cosen, be it so.

 _King._ O know you not the Cittie fauours them,
 And they haue troopes of soldiers at their becke?   [eaa063]

 _Exet._ But when the D. is slaine, theile quicklie flie.   [eaa064]

 _King._ Far be it from the thoughtes of _Henries_ hart,   ·eaa065·
 To make a shambles of the parlement house.
 Cosen of _Exeter_, words, frownes, and threats,
 Shall be the warres that Henrie meanes to vse.
 Thou factious duke of Yorke, descend my throne,
 I am thy soueraigne.   ·eaa070·

 _York._ Thou art deceiu’d: I am thine.

 _Exet._ For shame come downe he made thee D. of (_York_.

 _York._ Twas mine inheritance as the kingdome is.   [eaa073]

 _Exet._ Thy father was a traytor to the crowne.

 _War._ _Exeter_ thou art a traitor to the crowne.   ·eaa075·
 In following this vsurping _Henry_.

 _Clif._ Whom should he follow but his naturall king.

 _War._ True _Clif._ and that is _Richard_ Duke of Yorke.   [eaa078]

 _King._ And shall I stande while thou sittest in my   [eaa079]
               throne?   ·eaa080·

 _York._ Content thy selfe it must and shall be so.

 _War._ Be Duke of _Lancaster_, let him be king.   [eaa082]

 _West._ Why? he is both king & Duke of _Lancaster_,
 And that the Earle of _Westmerland_ shall mainetaine.

 _War._ And _Warwike_ shall disproue it. You forget   ·eaa085·
 That we are those that chaste you from the field
 And slew your father, and with colours spred,
 Marcht through the Cittie to the pallas gates.

 _Nor._ No _Warwike_ I remember it to my griefe,   [eaa089]
 And by his soule thou and thy house shall rew it.   ·eaa090·

 _West._ _Plantagenet_ of thee and of thy sonnes,
 Thy kinsmen and thy friendes, Ile haue more liues,
 Then drops of bloud were in my fathers vaines.

 _Clif._ Vrge it no more, least in reuenge thereof,
 I send thee _Warwike_ such a messenger,
 As shall reueng his death before I stirre.   ·eaa095·

 _War._ Poore _Clifford_, how I skorn thy worthles threats

 _York._ Wil ye we shew our title to the crowne,
 Or else our swords shall plead it in the field?

 _King._ What title haste thou traitor to the Crowne?
 Thy father was as thou art Duke of _Yorke_,   ·eaa100·
 Thy grandfather _Roger Mortimer_ earle of _March_,
 I am the sonne of Henrie the Fift who tamde the _French_,
 And made the Dolphin stoope, and seazd vpon their   [eaa103]
 Townes and prouinces.

 _War._ Talke not of _France_ since thou hast lost it all.   ·eaa105·

 _King._ The Lord protector lost it and not I,
 When I was crownd I was but nine months old.

 _Rich._ You are olde enough now and yet me thinkes you lose,   [eaa108]
 Father teare the Crowne from the Vsurpers head.

 _Edw._ Do so sweet father, set it on your head.   ·eaa110·

 _Mont._ Good brother as thou lou’st & honorst armes,
 Lets fight it out and not stand cauilling thus.   [eaa112]

 _Rich._ Sound drums and trumpets & the king will fly.

 _York._ Peace sonnes:

 _Northum._ Peace thou and giue king Henry leauē to speake.   [eaa115]

 _King._ Ah _Plantagenet_, why seekest thou to depose (me?   [eaa116]
 Are we not both both _Plantagenets_ by birth,   [eaa117]
 And from two brothers lineallie discent?   [eaa118]
 Suppose by right and equitie thou be king,
 Thinkst thou that I will leaue my kinglie seate   ·eaa120·
 Wherein my father and my grandsire sat?
 No, first shall warre vnpeople this my realme,
 I and our colours often borne in _France_,
 And now in _England_ to our harts great sorrow
 Shall be my winding sheete, why faint you Lords?   ·eaa125·
 My titles better farre than his.   [eaa126]

 _War._ Proue it _Henrie_ and thou shalt be king?

 _King._ Why _Henrie_ the fourth by conquest got the Crowne.

 _York._ T‛was by rebellion gainst his soueraigne.   [eaa129]

 _King._ I know not what to saie my titles weake,
 Tell me maie not a king adopt an heire?

 _War._ What then?

 _King._ Then am I lawfull king  For _Richard_
 The second in the view of manie Lords
 Resignde the Crowne to _Henrie_ the fourth,   [eaa135]
 Whose heire my Father was, and I am his.

 _York._ I tell thee he rose against him being his
 Soueraigne, & made him to resigne the crown perforce.   [eaa138]

 _War._ Suppose my Lord he did it vnconstrainde,
 Thinke you that were preiudiciall to the Crowne?   ·eaa140·

 _Exet._ No, for he could not resigne the Crowne,
 But that the next heire must succeed and raigne.

 _King._ Art thou against vs, Duke of _Exceter_?

 _Exet._ His is the right, and therefore pardon me.

 _King._ All will reuolt from me and turne to him.   ·eaa145·

 _Northum._ _Plantagenet_ for all the claime thou laist,   [eaa146]
 Thinke not king _Henry_ shall be thus deposde?

 _War._ Deposde he shall be in despight of thee.

 _North._ Tush _Warwike_, Thou art deceiued? tis not thy   [eaa149]
 Southerne powers of _Essex_, _Suffolk_, _Norffolke_, and of   [eaa150]

 _Kent_. that makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
 Can set the Duke vp in despight of me.

 _Cliff._  King _Henrie_ be thy title right or wrong,
 Lord _Clifford_ vowes to fight in thy defence.
 Maie that ground gape and swallow me aliue,   ·eaa155·
 Where I do kneele to him that slew my father.

 _King._ O _Clifford_, how thy words reuiue my soule.

 _York._ _Henry_ of _Lancaster_ resigne thy crowne.
 What mutter you? or what conspire you Lords?   [eaa159]

 _War._  Doe right vnto this princelie Duke of _Yorke_,   ·eaa160·
 Or I will fill the house with armed men,

    Enter Souldiers.

 And ouer the chaire of state where now he sits,
 Wright vp his title with thy vsurping bloud.   [eaa163]

 _King._ O _Warwike_, heare me speake.
 Let me but raigne in quiet whilst I liue.   [eaa165]

 _York._ Confirme the crowne to me and to mine heires
 And thou shalt raigne in quiet whilst thou liu’st.

 _King._ Conuey the souldiers hence, and then I will.

 _War._ Captaine conduct them into _Tuthill_ fieldes.

 _Clif._ What wrong is this vnto the Prince your son?   ·eaa170·

 _War._ What good is this for _England_ and himselfe?

 _Northum._ Base, fearefull, and despairing _Henry_.

 _Clif._ How hast thou wronged both thy selfe and vs?

 _West._ I cannot staie to heare these Articles.      _Exit._   [eaa174]

 _Clif._ Nor I, Come cosen lets go tell the Queene.   [eaa175]

 _Northum._ Be thou a praie vnto the house of _Yorke_,
 And die in bands for this vnkingly deed.      _Exit._   [eaa177]

 _Clif._ In dreadfull warre maist thou be ouercome,
 Or liue in peace abandon’d and despisde.      _Exit._

 _Exet._ They seeke reuenge, and therefore will not yeeld my
               Lord.   [eaa180]

 _King._ Ah _Exeter_?

 _War._ Why should you sigh my Lord?

 _King._ Not for my selfe Lord _Warwike_, but my sonne,
 Whom I vnnaturallie shall disinherit.
 But be it as it maie: I heere intaile the Crowne   ·eaa185·
 To thee and to thine heires, conditionallie,
 That here thou take thine oath, to cease these ciuill   [eaa187]
 Broiles, and whilst I liue to honour me as thy king and Soueraigne.

 _York._ That oath I willinglie take and will performe.

 _War._ Long liue king _Henry_. _Plantagenet_ embrace him?   [eaa190]

 _King._ And long liue thou and all thy forward sonnes.

 _York._ Now _Yorke_ and _Lancaster_ are reconcilde.

 _Exet._ Accurst be he that seekes to make them foes,

    Sound trumpets.

 _York._ My Lord Ile take my leaue, for Ile to _Wakefield_,   [eaa194]
 To my castell.      _Exit Yorke_ and his sonnes.   [eaa195]

 _War._ And Ile keepe _London_ with my souldiers.      _Exit._

 _Norf._ And _I_le to _Norffolke_ with my followers.      _Exit._

 _Mont._ And I to the sea from whence I came.      _Exit._

    Enter the _Queene_ and the _Prince_.

 _Exet._ My Lord here comes the Queen, Ile steale away.

 _King._ And so will _I_.   ·eaa200·

 _Queene._ Naie staie, or else I follow thee.   [eaa201]

 _King._ Be patient gentle _Queene_, and then Ile staie.

 _Quee._ What patience can there? ah timerous man,   [eaa203]
 Thou hast vndoone thy selfe, thy sonne, and me,
 And giuen our rights vnto the house of _Yorke_.   [eaa205]
 Art thou a king and wilt be forst to yeeld?
 Had I beene there, the souldiers should haue tost
 Me on their launces points, before I would haue
 Granted to their wils. The Duke is made
 Protector of the land: Sterne _Fawconbridge_   ·eaa210·
 Commands the narrow seas. And thinkst thou then
 To sseepe secure? I heere diuorce me _Henry_   [eaa212]
 From thy bed, vntill that Act of Parlement
 Be recalde, wherein thou yeeldest to the house of _Yorke_.
 The Northen Lords that haue forsworne thy colours,   [eaa215]
 Will follow mine if once they see them spred,
 And spread they shall vnto thy deepe disgrace.
 Come sonne, lets awaie and leaue him heere alone.   [eaa218]

 _King._ Staie gentle _Margaret_, and here me speake.

 _Queene._ Thou hast spoke too much alreadie, therefore be
               still.   ·eaa220·

 _King._ Gentle sonne _Edwarde_, wilt thou staie with me?

 _Quee._ I, to be murdred by his enemies.      _Exit._   [eaa222]

 _Prin._ When I returne with victorie from the field,
 Ile see your Grace, till then Ile follow her.      _Exit._

 _King._ Poore _Queene_, her loue to me and to the prince Her
               sonne,   ·eaa225·
 Makes hir in furie thus forget hir selfe.   [eaa226]
 Reuenged maie shee be on that accursed Duke.
 Come cosen of _Exeter_, staie thou here,
 For _Clifford_ and those Northern Lords be gone
 I feare towards _Wakefield_, to disturbe the Duke.   ·eaa230·


SCENE II.

Enter _Edward_, and _Richard_, and _Montague_.

 _Edw._ Brother, and cosen Montague, giue mee leaue to speake.

 _Rich._ Nay, I can better plaie the Orator.

 _Mont._ But I haue reasons strong and forceable.

    Enter the Duke of _Yorke_.

 _York._ Howe nowe sonnes what at a iarre amongst your selues?

 _Rich._ No father, but a sweete contention, about that   [eab005]
 which concernes your selfe and vs, The crowne of England
 father.

 _York._ The crowne boy, why _Henries_ yet aliue,   [eab008]
 And I haue sworne that he shall raigne in quiet till   [eab009]
 His death.   ·eab010·

 _Edw._ But I would breake an hundred othes to raigne   [eab011]
 one yeare.

 _Rich._ And if it please your grace to giue me leaue,
 Ile shew your grace the waie to saue your oath,
 And dispossesse king _Henrie_ from the crowne.   ·eab015·

 _Yorke_ I prethe _Dicke_ let me heare thy deuise.

 _Rich._ Then thus my Lord. An oath is of no moment   [eab017]
 Being not sworne before a lawfull magistrate.
 _Henry_ is none but doth vsurpe your right.
 And yet your grace stands bound to him by oath.   ·eab020·
 Then noble father resolue your selfe,
 And once more claime the crowne.

 _Yorke_ _I_, saist thou so boie? why then it shall be so.
 _I_ am resolude to win the crowne, or die.
 Edward, rhou shalt to _Edmund Brooke_ Lord _Cobham_,   [eab025]
 With whom the _Kentishmen_ will willinglie rise:
 Thou cosen _Montague_, shalt to _Norffolke_ straight,
 And bid the Duke to muster vppe his souldiers,
 And come to me to _Wakefield_ presentlie.
 And _Richard_ thou to _London_ strait shalt post,   ·eab030·
 And bid _Richard Neuill_ Earle of _Warwike_
 To leaue the cittie, and with his men of warre,
 To meet me at Saint _Albons_ ten daies hence.   [eab033]
 My selfe heere in _Sandall_ castell will prouide
 Both men and monie to furder our attempts.   ·eab035·
 Now, what newes?      Enter a Messenger.

 _Mes._ My Lord, the _Queene_ with thirtie thousand men,
 Accompanied with the Earles of _Cumberland_,
 _Nurthumberland_ and _Westmerland_, and others of the   [eab039]
 House of _Lancaster_, are marching towards _Wakefield_,   ·eab040·
 To besiedge you in your castell heere.

    Enter sir _Iohn_ and sir _Hugh Mortimer_.

 _Yorke_ A Gods name, let them come.  Cosen _Montague_   [eab042]
 post you hence: and boies staie you with me.

 Sir _Iohn_ and sir _Hugh Mortemers_ mine vncles,   [eab044]
 Your welcome to _Sandall_ in an happie houre,   [eab045]
 The armie of the Queene meanes to besiedge vs.

 Sir _Iohn_. Shee shall not neede my Lorde, weele meete her in the
               field.   [eab047]

 _York_ What with fiue thousand souldiers vncle?   [eab048]

 _Rich._ I father, with fiue hundred for a need,
 A womans generall, what should you feare?   [eab050]

 _York._ Indeed, manie braue battels haue I woon   [eab051]
 In _Normandie_, when as the enimie
 Hath bin ten to one, and why should I now doubt
 Of the like successe? I am resolu’d. Come lets goe.

 _Edw._ Lets martch awaie, I heare their drums.      _Exit._   [eab055]


SCENE III.

Alarmes, and then enter the yong Earle of _Rutland_ and his Tutor.

 _Tutor._ Oh flie my Lord, lets leaue the Castell,
 And flie to _Wakefield_ straight.

    Enter _Clifford_.

 _Rut._ O Tutor, looke where bloudie _Clifford_ comes.

 _Clif._ Chaplin awaie, thy Priesthood saues thy life,   [eac004]
 As for the brat of that accursed Duke   ·eac005·
 Whose father slew my father, he shall die.

 _Tutor_ Oh _Clifford_ spare this tender Lord, least
 Heauen reuenge it on thy head: Oh saue his life.   [eac008]

 _Clif._ Soldiers awaie and drag him hence perforce:
 Awaie with the villaine.      _Exit_ the Chaplein.   [eac010]
 How now, what dead alreadie? or is it feare that
 Makes him close his eies? Ile open them.

 _Rut._ So lookes the pent vp Lion on the lambe,
 And so he walkes insulting ouer his praie,   [eac014]
 And so he turnes againe to rend his limmes in sunder,   ·eac015·
 Oh _Clifford_, kill me with thy sword, and
 Not with such a cruell threatning looke,
 I am too meane a subiect for thy wrath,   [eac018]
 Be thou reuengde on men, and let me liue.

 _Clif._ In vaine thou speakest poore boy: my fathers   ·eac020·
 Bloud hath stopt the passage where thy words shoulde enter.   [eac021]

 _Rut._ Then let my fathers blood ope it againe? he is a   [eac022]
 Man, and _Clifford_ cope with him.

 _Clif._  Had I thy brethren here, their liues and thine
 Were not reuenge sufficient for me.   ·eac025·
 Or should _I_ dig vp thy forefathers graues,
 And hang their rotten coffins vp in chaines,
 It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my hart.
 The sight of anie of the house of _Yorke_,
 Is as a furie to torment my soule.   ·eac030·
 Therefore till _I_ root out that curssed line
 And leaue not one on earth, _I_le liue in hell therefore.

 _Rut._ Oh let me praie, before _I_ take my death.
 To thee _I_ praie: Sweet _Clifford_ pittie me.

 _Clif._ _I_, such pitie as my rapiers point affords.   ·eac035·

 _Rut._ _I_ neuer did thee hurt, wherefore wilt thou kill mee?

 _Clif._ Thy father hath.

 _Rut._ But twas ere _I_ was borne:   [eac038]
 Thou hast one sonne, for his sake pittie me,
 Least in reuenge thereof, sith God is iust,   ·eac040·
 He be as miserablie slaine as _I_.
 Oh, let me liue in prison all my daies,
 And when _I_ giue occasion for offence,
 Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.

 _Clif._ No cause?  Thy Father slew my father, therefore Die.   ·eac045·
 _Plantagenet_ I come _Plantagenet_,
 And this thy sonnes bloud cleauing to my blade,
 Shall rust vpon my weapon, till thy bloud
 Congeald with his, doe make me wipe off both.      _Exit._

    Alarmes, Enter the Duke of _Yorke solus_.

 _Yorke_ Ah _Yorke_, post to thy castell, saue thy life,   ·eac050·
 The goale is lost thou house of _Lancaster_,   [eac051]
 Thrise happie chance is it for thee and thine,
 That heauen abridgde my daies and cals me hence,
 But God knowes what chance hath betide my sonnes:
 But this I know they haue demeand themselues,   ·eac055·
 Like men borne to renowne by life or death:
 _T_hree times this daie came _Richard_ to my sight,
 And cried courage Father: Victorie or death.
 And twise so oft came _Edward_ to my view,
 With purple Faulchen painted to the hilts,   ·eac060·
 In bloud of those whom he had slaughtered.
 Oh harke, _I_ heare the drums? No waie to flie:   [eac062]
 No waie to saue my life? And heere _I_ staie:
 And heere my life must end.

    Enter the _Queene_, _Clifford_, _Northumberland_, and souldiers.

 Come bloudie _Clifford_, rough _Northumberland_,
 I dare your quenchlesse furie to more bloud:
 This is the But, and this abides your shot.

 _Northum._ Yeeld to our mercies proud _Plantagenet_.

 _Clif._ I, to such mercie as his ruthfull arme
 With downe right paiment lent vnto my father,   ·eac070·
 Now _Phaeton_ hath tumbled from his carre,
 And made an euening at the noone tide pricke.

 _York._  My ashes like the _Phœnix_ maie bring forth
 A bird that will reuenge it on you all,
 And in that hope I cast mine eies to heauen,   ·eac075·
 Skorning what ere you can afflict me with:
 Why staie you Lords? what, multitudes and feare?

 _Clif._ So cowards fight when they can flie no longer:
 So Doues doe pecke the Rauens piersing tallents:
 So desperate theeues all hopelesse of their liues,   ·eac080·
 Breath out inuectives gainst the officers.   [eac081]

 _York._ Oh _Clifford_, yet bethinke thee once againe,
 And in thy minde orerun my former time:
 And bite thy toung that slaunderst him with cowardise,
 Whose verie looke hath made thee quake ere this.   ·eac085·

 _Clif._ I will not bandie with thee word for word,
 But buckle with thee blowes twise two for one.

 _Queene._  Hold valiant _Clifford_ for a thousand causes,
 I would prolong the traitors life a while.
 Wrath makes him death, speake thou _Northumberland_.   [eac090]

 _Nor._ Hold _Clifford_, doe not honour him so much,
 To pricke thy finger though to wound his hart:
 What valure were it when a curre doth grin,   [eac093]
 For one to thrust his hand betweene his teeth,
 When he might spurne him with his foote awaie?   ·eac095·
 Tis warres prise to take all aduantages,
 And ten to one, is no impeach in warres.

    Fight and take him.

 _Clif._ I, I, so striues the Woodcocke with the gin.

 _North._ So doth the cunnie struggle with the net.

 _York._ So triumphs theeues vpon their conquered   [eac100]
 Bootie: So true men yeeld by robbers ouermatcht.   [eac101]

 _North._  What will your grace haue done with him?

 _Queen._  Braue warriors, _Clifford_ & _Northumberland_
 Come make him stand vpon this molehill here,
 That aimde at mountaines with outstretched arme,   ·eac105·
 And parted but the shaddow with his hand.
 Was it you that reuelde in our Parlement,
 And made a prechment of your high descent?
 Where are your messe of sonnes to backe you now?
 The wanton _Edward_, and the lustie _George_?   ·eac110·
 Or where is that valiant _Crookbackt_ prodegie?   [eac111]
 Dickey your boy, that with his grumbling voice,
 Was wont to cheare his Dad in mutinies?
 Or amongst the rest, where is your darling _Rutland_?   [eac114]
 Looke _Yorke_? I dipt this napkin in the bloud,   ·eac115·
 That valiant _Clifford_ with his rapiers point,   [eac116]
 Made issue from the bosome of thy boy.
 And if thine eies can water for his death,
 I giue thee this to drie thy cheeks withall.
 Alas poore _Yorke_? But that I hate thee much,   ·eac120·
 _I_ should lament thy miserable state?   [eac121]
 I prethee greeue to make me merrie _Yorke_?   [eac122]
 Stamp, raue and fret, that I maie sing and dance.
 What? hath thy fierie hart so parcht thine entrailes,   [eac124]
 That not a teare can fall for _Rutlands_ death?   ·eac125·
 Thou wouldst be feede I see to make me sport.
 _Yorke_ cannot speake, vnlesse he weare a crowne.
 A crowne for _Yorke_? and Lords bow low to him.   [eac128]
 So: hold you his hands, whilst _I_ doe set it on.   [eac129]
 I, now lookes he like a king?   [eac130]
 This is he that tooke king _Henries_ chaire,
 And this is he was his adopted aire.   [eac132]
 But how is it that great _Plantagenet_,
 Is crownd so soone, and broke his holie oath,
 As I bethinke me you should not be king,   ·eac135·
 Till our _Henry_ had shooke hands with death,
 And will you impale your head with _Henries_ glorie,
 And rob his temples of the Diadem
 Now in his life against your holie oath?
 Oh, tis a fault too too vnpardonable.   ·eac140·
 Off with the crowne, and with the crowne his head,
 And whilst we breath, take time to doe him dead.

 _Clif._ Thats my office for my fathers death.   [eac143]

 _Queen._ Yet stay: & lets here the Orisons he makes.

 _York._ She wolfe of _France_, but worse than Wolues of
               _France_:   ·eac145·
 Whose tongue more poison’d than the Adders tooth:   [eac146]
 How ill beseeming is it in thy sexe,
 To triumph like an _Amazonian_ trull
 Vpon his woes, whom Fortune captiuates?
 But that thy face is visard like, vnchanging,   [eac150]
 Made impudent by use of euill deeds:
 _I_ would assaie, proud Queene, to make thee blush:
 To tell thee of whence thou art, from whom deriu’de,
 Twere shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shamelesse.   [eac154]
 Thy father beares the type of king of _Naples_,   [eac155]
 Of both the _Sissiles_ and _Ierusalem_,   [eac156]
 Yet not so wealthie as an English Yeoman.
 Hath that poore Monarch taught thee to insult?
 It needes not, or it bootes thee not proud Queene,
 Vnlesse the Adage must be verifide:   ·eac160·
 That beggers mounted, run their horse to death.
 Tis beautie, that oft makes women proud,
 But God he wots thy share thereof is small.
 Tis gouernment, that makes them most admirde,
 The contrarie doth make thee wondred at.   ·eac165·
 Tis vertue that makes them seeme deuine,   [eac166]
 The want thereof makes thee abhominable.
 Thou art as opposite to euerie good,
 As the _Antipodes_ are vnto vs,
 Or as the south to the Septentrion.   ·eac170·
 Oh Tygers hart wrapt in a womans hide?   [eac171]
 How couldst thou draine the life bloud of the childe,
 To bid the father wipe his eies withall,
 And yet be seene to beare a womans face?
 Women are milde, pittifull, and flexible,   ·eac175·
 Thou indurate, sterne, rough, remorcelesse.
 Bids thou me rage? why now thou hast thy will.
 Wouldst haue me weepe? why so thou hast thy wish,
 For raging windes blowes vp a storme of teares,   [eac179]
 And when the rage alaies the raine begins.   [eac180]
 These teares are my sweet _Rutlands_ obsequies,
 And euerie drop begs vengeance as it fals,
 On thee fell _Clifford_, and the false French woman.   [eac183]

 _North._ Beshrew me but his passions moue me so,
 As hardlie can I checke mine eies from teares.   [eac185]

 _York._ That face of his the hungrie Cannibals
 Could not haue tucht, would not haue staind with bloud
 But you are more inhumaine, more inexorable,
 O ten times more then Tygers of _Arcadia_.
 See ruthlesse _Queene_ a haplesse fathers teares.   ·eac190·
 This cloth thou dipts in bloud of my sweet boy,
 And loe with teares I wash the bloud awaie.
 Keepe thou the napkin and go boast of that,
 And if thou tell the heauie storie well,   [eac194]
 Vpon my soule the hearers will sheed teares,   [eac195]
 I, euen my foes will sheed fast falling teares,   [eac196]
 And saie, alas, it was a pitteous deed.
 Here, take the crowne, and with the crowne my curse,
 And in thy need such comfort come to thee,
 As now _I_ reape at thy two cruell hands.   [eac200]
 Hard-harted _Clifford_, take me from the world,   [eac201]
 My soule to heauen, my bloud vpon your heads.

 _North._ Had he bin slaughterman of all my kin,
 _I_ could not chuse but weepe with him to see,
 How inlie anger gripes his hart.   [eac205]

 _Quee._ What weeping ripe, my Lorde _Northumberland_?
 Thinke but vpon the wrong he did vs all,
 And that will quicklie drie your melting tears.

 _Clif._ _T_hears for my oath, thears for my fathers death.   [eac209]

 _Queene._ And thears to right our gentle harted kind.   [eac210]

 _York._ Open thy gates of mercie gratious God,
 My soule flies foorth to meet with thee.

 _Queene._ Off with his head and set it on _Yorke_ Gates,
 So _Yorke_ maie ouerlooke the towne of _Yorke_.
               _Exeunt omnes._


SCENE IV.

Enter _Edward_ and _Richard_, with drum and Souldiers.

 _Edw._ After this dangerous fight and haplesse warre,
 How doth my noble brother _Richard_ fare?

 _Rich._ I cannot ioy vntil I be resolu’de,
 Where our right valiant father is become.
 How often did I see him beare himselfe,   ·ead005·
 As doth a lion midst a heard of neat,
 So fled his enemies our valiant father,   [ead007]
 Me thinkes tis pride enough to be his sonne.

    Three sunnes appeare in the aire.

 _Edw._ Loe how the morning opes her golden gates,
 And takes her farewell of the glorious sun,   ·ead010·
 Dasell mine eies or doe I see three suns?   [ead011]

 _Rich._ Three glorious suns, not seperated by a racking   [ead012]
 Cloud, but seuered in a pale cleere shining skie.
 See, see, they ioine, embrace, and seeme to kisse,
 As if they vowde some league inuiolate:   ·ead015·
 Now are they but one lampe, one light, one sun,
 In this the heauens doth figure some euent.

 _Edw._ _I_ thinke it cites vs brother to the field,
 That we the sonnes of braue _Plantagenet_,
 Alreadie each one shining by his meed,   ·ead020·
 May ioine in one and ouerpeere the world,
 As this the earth, and therefore hence forward,
 Ile beare vpon my Target, three faire shining suns.
 But what art thou? that lookest so heauilie?   [ead024]

 _Mes._ Oh one that was a wofull looker on,   ·ead025·
 When as the noble Duke of _Yorke_ was slaine.

 _Edw._ O speake no more, for I can heare no more.

 _Rich._ Tell on thy tale, for _I_ will heare it all.

 _Mes._ When as the noble Duke was put to flight,
 And then pursu’de by _Clifford_ and the _Queene_,   ·ead030·
 And manie souldiers moe, who all at once
 Let driue at him and forst the Duke to yeeld:   [ead032]
 And then they set him on a molehill there,
 And crownd the gratious Duke in high despite,
 Who then with teares began to waile his fall.   ·ead035·
 The ruthlesse _Queene_ perceiuing he did weepe,
 Gaue him a handkercher to wipe his eies,
 Dipt in the bloud of sweet young _Rutland_
 By rough _Clifford_ slaine: who weeping tooke it vp.
 _T_hen through his brest they thrust their bloudy swordes,   ·ead040·
 Who like a lambe fell at the butchers feete.
 Then on the gates of _Yorke_ they set his head,
 And there it doth remaine the piteous spectacle
 That ere mine eies beheld.

 _Edw._ Sweet Duke of _Yorke_ our prop to leane vpon,   ·ead045·
 Now thou art gone there is no hope for vs:
 Now my soules pallace is become a prison.
 Oh would she breake from compasse of my breast,
 For neuer shall I haue more ioie.

 _Rich._ I cannot weepe, for all my breasts moisture   ·ead050·
 Scarse serues to quench my furnace burning hart:   [ead051]
 I cannot ioie till this white rose be dide,
 Euen in the hart bloud of the house of _Lancaster_.
 _Richard_, I bare thy name, and _I_le reuenge thy death,   [ead054]
 Or die my selfe in seeking of reuenge.   ·ead055·

 _Edw._ His name that valiant Duke hath left with thee,
 His chaire and Dukedome that remaines for me.

 _Rich._ Nay, if thou be that princely Eagles bird,
 Shew thy descent by gazing gainst the sunne.   [ead059]
 For chaire, and dukedome, Throne and kingdome saie:   ·ead060·
 For either that is thine, or else thou wert not his?   [ead061]

    Enter the Earle of _Warwike_, _Montague_, with drum, ancient, and
    souldiers.

 _War._ How now faire Lords: what fare? what newes abroad?

 _Rich._ Ah _Warwike_? should we report the balefull   [ead063]
 Newes, and at each words deliuerance stab poinyardes
 In our flesh till all were told, the words would adde   ·ead065·
 More anguish then the wounds.
 Ah valiant Lord the Duke of _Yorke_ is slaine.

 _Edw._ Ah _Warwike Warwike_, that _Plantagenet_,
 Which held thee deere: I, euen as his soules redemption,   [ead069]
 Is by the sterne _L. Clifford_, done to death.   [ead070]

 _War._ Ten daies a go I drownd those newes in teares.   [ead071]
 And now to adde more measure to your woes,
 I come to tell you things since then befalne.   [ead073]
 After the bloudie fraie at _Wakefield_ fought,
 Where your braue father breath’d his latest gaspe,   ·ead075·
 Tidings as swiflie as the post could runne,   [ead076]
 Was brought me of your losse, and his departure.
 I then in London keeper of the _King_,
 Mustred my souldiers, gathered flockes of friends,
 And verie well appointed as I thought,   ·ead080·
 Marcht to saint _Albons_ to entercept the _Queene_,   [ead081]
 Bearing the _King_ in my behalfe along,
 For by my scoutes I was aduertised,
 That she was comming, with a full intent
 _T_o dash your late decree in parliament,
 Touching king _Henries_ heires and your succession.
 Short tale to make, we at Saint _Albons_ met,
 Our battles ioinde, and both sides fiercelie fought:
 But whether twas the coldnesse of the king,   [ead089]
 He lookt full gentlie on his warlike _Queene_,   [ead090]
 That robde my souldiers of their heated spleene.
 Or whether twas report of his successe,
 Or more then common feare of _Cliffords_ rigor,
 Who thunders to his captaines bloud and death,
 I cannot tell. But to conclude with truth,   ·ead095·
 Their weapons like to lightnings went and came.
 Our souldiers like the night Owles lasie flight,   [ead097]
 Or like an idle thresher with a flaile,
 Fel gentlie downe as if they smote their friends.
 I cheerd them vp with iustice of the cause,   ·ead100·
 With promise of hie paie and great rewardes,
 But all in vaine, they had no harts to fight,
 Nor we in them no hope to win the daie,
 So that We fled. The king vnto the _Queene_,
 Lord _George_ your brother, _Norffolke_, and my selfe,   ·ead105·
 In hast, post hast, are come to ioine with you,
 For in the marches here we heard you were,
 Making another head to fight againe.   [ead108]

 _Edw._ Thankes gentle _Warwike_.
 How farre hence is the Duke with his power?   ·ead110·
 And when came _George_ from _Burgundie_ to _England_?

 _War._ Some fiue miles off the Duke is with his power,
 But as for your brother he was latelie sent
 From your kind Aunt, Duches of _Burgundie_,
 With aide of souldiers gainst this needfull warre.   [ead115]

 _Rich._ Twas ods belike, when valiant _Warwike_ fled.
 Oft haue I heard thy praises in pursute,
 But nere till now thy scandall of retire.

 _War._  Nor now my scandall _Richard_ dost thou heare,
 For thou shalt know that this right hand of mine,   ·ead120·
 Can plucke the Diadem from faint _Henries_ head,
 And wring the awefull scepter from his fist:
 Were he as famous and as bold in warre,
 As he is famde for mildnesse, peace and praier.

 _Rich._ I know it well Lord _Warwike_ blame me not,   ·ead125·
 Twas loue I bare thy glories made me speake.
 But in this troublous time, whats to be done?   [ead127]
 Shall we go throw away our coates of steele,
 And clad our bodies in blacke mourning gownes,
 Numbring our _Auemaries_ with our beades?   ·ead130·
 Or shall we on the helmets of our foes,
 Tell our deuotion with reuengefull armes?
 _I_f for the last, saie _I_, and to it Lords.

 _War._ Why therefore _Warwike_ came to find you out,
 And therefore comes my brother _Montague_.   ·ead135·
 Attend me Lords, the proud insulting Queene,
 With _Clifford_, and the haught _Northumberland_,
 And of their feather manie mo proud birdes,   [ead138]
 Haue wrought the easie melting king like waxe.
 He sware consent to your succession,   ·ead140·
 His oath inrolled in the Parliament.
 But now to London all the crew are gone,
 To frustrate his oath or what besides   [ead143]
 May make against the house of _Lancaster_.
 Their power _I_ gesse them fifty thousand strong.   ·ead145·
 Now if the helpe of _Norffolke_ and my selfe,
 Can but amount to 48. thousand,   [ead147]
 With all the friendes that thou braue earle of _March_,
 Among the louing Welshmen canst procure,
 Why via, To London will we march amaine,   ·ead150·
 And once againe bestride our foming steedes,
 And once againe crie charge vpon the foe,
 But neuer once againe turne backe and flie.

 _Rich._ I, now me thinkes I heare great _Warwike_ speake:
 Nere maie he liue to see a sunshine daie,   ·ead155·
 _T_hat cries retire, when _Warwike_ bids him stay.

 _Edw._ Lord _Warwike_, on thy shoulder will I leane,
 And when thou faints, must _Edward_ fall:   [ead158]
 Which perill heauen forefend.

 _War._ No longer Earle of _March_, but Duke of _Yorke_,   ·ead160·
 The next degree, is Englands royall king:   [ead161]
 And king of England shalt thou be proclaimde,
 In euery burrough as we passe along:
 And he that casts not vp his cap for ioie,
 Shall for the offence make forfeit of his head.   [ead165]
 King _Edward_, valiant _Richard_, _Montague_,
 Stay we no longer dreaming of renowne,
 But forward to effect these resolutions.

    Enter a Messenger.

 _Mes._ The Duke of _Norffolke_ sends you word by me,
 The _Queene_ is comming with a puissant power,   ·ead170·
 And craues your companie for speedie councell.

 _War._ Why then it sorts braue Lordes. Lets march away.   [ead172]
               _Exeunt Omnes._


SCENE V.

Enter the _King_ and _Queene_, Prince _Edward_, and the Northerne
Earles, with drum and Souldiers.

 _Quee._ Welcome my Lord to this braue town of _York_.
 Yonders the head of that ambitious enemie,   [eae002]
 That sought to be impaled with your crowne.
 Doth not the obiect please your eie my Lord?

 _King._ Euen as the rockes please them that feare their
               wracke.   ·eae005·
 Withhold reuenge deare God, tis not my fault,
 Nor wittinglie haue I infringde my vow.

 _Clif._ My gratious Lord, this too much lenitie,
 And harmefull pittie must be laid aside,
 To whom do Lyons cast their gentle lookes?   ·eae010·
 Not to the beast that would vsurpe his den.
 Whose hand is that the sauage Beare doth licke?
 Not his that spoiles his young before his face.
 Whose scapes the lurking serpentes mortall sting?   [eae014]
 Not he that sets his foot vpon her backe.   ·eae015·
 The smallest worme will turne being troden on,
 And Doues will pecke, in rescue of their broode.
 Ambitious _Yorke_ did leuell at thy Crowne,
 Thou smiling, while he knit his angrie browes.
 He but a Duke, would haue his sonne a king,   ·eae020·
 And raise his issue like a louing sire.
 Thou being a king blest with a goodlie sonne,
 Didst giue consent to disinherit him,
 Which argude thee a most vnnaturall father.
 Vnreasonable creatures feed their yong,   ·eae025·
 And though mans face be fearefull to their eies,
 Yet in protection of their tender ones,
 Who hath not seene them euen with those same wings
 Which they haue sometime vsde in fearefull flight,
 Make warre with him, that climes vnto their nest,   ·eae030·
 Offring their owne liues in their yongs defence?
 For shame my Lord, make them your president,
 Were it not pittie that this goodlie boy,
 should lose his birth right through his fathers fault?   [eae034]
 And long hereafter saie vnto his child,   ·eae035·
 What my great grandfather and grandsire got,
 My carelesse father fondlie gaue awaie?
 Looke on the boy and let his manlie face,
 Which promiseth successefull fortune to vs all,
 Steele thy melting thoughtes,   ·eae040·
 To keepe thine owne, and leaue thine owne with him.

 _King._ Full wel hath _Clifford_ plaid the Orator,
 Inferring arguments of mighty force.
 But tell me, didst thou neuer yet heare tell,
 That things euill got had euer bad successe,   [eae045]
 And happie euer was it for that sonne,
 Whose father for his hoording went to hell?
 I leaue my sonne my vertuous deedes behind,
 And would my father had left me no more,
 For all the rest is held at such a rate,   ·eae050·
 As askes a thousand times more care to keepe,
 Then maie the present profit counteruaile.
 Ah cosen _Yorke_, would thy best friendes did know,
 How it doth greeue me that thy head stands there.

 _Quee._ My Lord, this harmefull pittie makes your followers
               faint.   ·eae055·
 You promisde knighthood to your princelie sonne.
 Vnsheath your sword and straight doe dub him knight.   [eae057]
 Kneele downe _Edward_.

 _King._  _Edward Plantagenet_, arise a knight,
 And learne this lesson boy, draw thy sword in right   [eae060]

 _Prince._ My gratious father by your kingly leaue,
 Ile draw it as apparant to the crowne,
 And in that quarrel vse it to the death.

 _Northum._ Why that is spoken like a toward prince.

    Enter a Messenger.

 _Mes._ Royall commaunders be in readinesse,   ·eae065·
 For with a band of fiftie thousand men,
 Comes _Warwike_ backing of the Duke of _Yorke_.
 And in the townes whereas they passe along,
 Proclaimes him king, and manie flies to him,
 Prepare your battels, for they be at hand.   ·eae070·

 _Clif._ I would your highnesse would depart the field,
 The _Queene_ hath best successe when you are absent.

 _Quee._ Do good my Lord, and leaue vs to our fortunes.

 _King._ Why thats my fortune, therefore Ile stay still.   [eae074]

 _Clif._ Be it with resolution then to fight.   ·eae075·

 _Prince._ Good father cheere these noble Lords,
 Vnsheath your sword, sweet father crie Saint _George_.

 _Clif._ Pitch we our battell heere, for hence wee will not moue.

    Enter the house of _Yorke_.

 _Edward._ Now periurde _Henrie_ wilt thou yeelde thy crowne,   [eae079]
 And kneele for mercie at thy soueraignes feete?   ·eae080·

 _Queen._ Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy,
 Becomes it thee to be thus malepert,
 Before thy king and lawfull soueraigne?

 _Edw._ _I_ am his king, and he should bend his knee,
 I was adopted heire by his consent.   ·eae085·

 _George._ Since when he hath broke his oath.
 For as we heare you that are king
 Though he doe weare the Crowne,
 Haue causde him by new act of Parlement   [eae089]
 To blot our brother out, and put his owne son in.   ·eae090·

 _Clif._ And reason _George_. Who should succeede the father but the
               son?   [eae091]

 _Rich._ Are you their butcher?   [eae092]

 _Clif._ _I Crookbacke_, here I stand to answere thee, or any   [eae093]
 of your sort.

 _Rich._ Twas you that kild yong _Rutland_, was it not?

 _Clif._ Yes, and old _Yorke_ too, and yet not satisfide.   ·eae095·

 _Rich._ For Gods sake Lords giue synald to the fight.   [eae096]

 _War._ What saiest thou _Henry_? wilt thou yeelde thy crowne?

 _Queen._ What, long tongde _War._ dare you speake?   [eae098]
 When you and _I_ met at saint _Albones_ last,
 Your legs did better seruice than your hands.   ·eae100·

 _War._ I, then twas my turne to flee, but now tis thine.   [eae101]

 _Clif._ You said so much before, and yet you fled.   [eae102]

 _War._ Twas not your valour _Clifford_, that droue mee
               thence.   [eae103]

 _Northum._ No, nor your manhood _Warwike_, that could make you
               staie.   [eae104]

 _Rich._  _Northumberland_, _Northumberland_, wee holde   [eae105]
 Thee reuerentlie. Breake off the parlie, for scarse
 I can refraine the execution of my big swolne
 Hart, against that _Clifford_ there, that
 Cruell child-killer.

 _Clif._ Why I kild thy father, calst thou him a child?   ·eae110·

 _Rich._ I like a villaine, and a trecherous coward,
 As thou didst kill our tender brother _Rutland_.
 But ere sunne set Ile make thee curse the deed.   [eae113]

 _King._ Haue doone with wordes great Lordes, and   [eae114]
 Heare me speake.

 _Queen._ Defie them then, or else hold close thy lips.   ·eae115·

 _King._ I prethe giue no limits to my tongue,
 I am a king and priuiledge to speake.   [eae117]

 _Clif._ My Lord the wound that bred this meeting here
 Cannot be cru’d with words, therefore be still.   [eae119]

 _Rich._ Then executioner vnsheath thy sword,   ·eae120·
 By him that made vs all I am resolu’de,
 That _Cliffords_ manhood hangs vpon his tongue.

 _Edw._ What saist thou _Henry_, shall _I_ haue my right or no?
 A thousand men haue broke their fast to daie,
 That nere shall dine, vnlesse thou yeeld the crowne.   ·eae125·

 _War._ If thou denie their blouds be on thy head,
 For _Yorke_ in iustice puts his armour on.

 _Prin._ If all be right that _Warwike_ saies is right,
 There is no wrong but all things must be right.

 _Rich._ Whosoeuer got thee, there thy mother stands,   ·eae130·
 For well I wot thou hast thy mothers tongue.

 _Queen._ But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam.
 But like a foule mishapen stygmaticke
 Markt by the destinies to be auoided,
 As venome Todes, or Lizards fainting lookes.   [eae135]

 _Rich._ Iron of _Naples_, hid with English gilt,
 Thy father beares the title of a king,
 As if a channell should be calde the Sea;
 Shames thou not, knowing from whence thou art de-   [eae139]
 Riu’de, to parlie thus with Englands lawfull heires?   ·eae140·

 _Edw._ A wispe of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
 _T_o make that shamelesse callet know her selfe,
 Thy husbands father reueld in the hart of _France_,
 And tam’de the French, and made the Dolphin stoope:
 And had he macht according to his state,   [eae145]
 He might haue kept that glorie till this daie.
 But when he tooke a begger to his bed,
 And gracst thy poore sire with his bridall daie,   [eae148]
 Then that sun-shine bred a showre for him
 Which washt his fathers fortunes out of France,   ·eae150·
 And heapt seditions on his crowne at home.
 For what hath mou’d these tumults but thy pride?
 Hadst thou beene meeke, our title yet had slept?   [eae153]
 And we in pittie of the gentle king,
 Had slipt our claime vntill an other age.   [eae155]

 _George._ But when we saw our summer brought the gaine,   [eae156]
 And that the haruest brought vs no increase,
 We set the axe to thy vsurping root,
 And though the edge haue something hit our selues,
 Yet know thou we will neuer cease to strike,   ·eae160·
 Till we haue hewne thee downe,
 Or bath’d thy growing with our heated blouds.

 _Edw._ And in this resolution, I defie thee,
 Not willing anie longer conference,   [eae164]
 Since thou deniest the gentle king to speake.   ·eae165·
 Sound trumpets, let our bloudie colours waue,
 And either victorie or else a graue.

 _Quee._ Staie _Edward_ staie.

 _Edw._ Hence wrangling woman, Ile no longer staie,   [eae169]
 Thy words will cost ten thousand liues to daie.   ·eae170·
               _Exeunt Omnes._ Alarmes.


SCENE VI

Enter _Warwike_.

 _War._ Sore spent with toile as runners with the race,
 _I_ laie me downe a little while to breath,
 _F_or strokes receiude, and manie blowes repaide,
 Hath robd my strong knit sinnews of their strength,
 And force perforce needes must _I_ rest my selfe.   [eaf005]

    Enter _Edward_.

 _Edw._ Smile gentle heauens or strike vngentle death,
 That we maie die vnlesse we gaine the daie:
 What fatall starre malignant frownes from heauen
 Vpon the harmelesse line of _Yorkes_ true house?

    Enter _George_.

 _George._ Come brother, come, lets to the field againe,   ·eaf010·
 For yet theres hope inough to win the daie:   [eaf011]
 Then let vs backe to cheere our fainting Troupes,
 Lest they retire now we haue left the field.   [eaf013]

 _War._ How now my lords: what hap, what hope of good?   [eaf014]

    Enter _Richard_ running.

 _Rich._ Ah _Warwike_, why haste thou withdrawne thy selfe?   ·eaf015·
 Thy noble father in the thickest thronges,
 Cride still for _Warwike_ his thrise valiant son,
 Vntill with thousand swords he was beset,
 And manie wounds made in his aged brest,
 And as he tottring sate vpon his steede,   [eaf020]
 He waft his hand to me and cride aloud:
 _Richard_, commend me to my valiant sonne,
 And still he cride _Warwike_ revenge my death,
 And with those words he tumbled off his horse,   [eaf024]
 And so the noble Salsbury gave vp the ghost.   ·eaf025·

 _War._ Then let the earth be drunken with his bloud,
 _I_le kill my horse because I will not flie:
 And here to God of heauen I make a vow,
 Neuer to passe from forth this bloudy field
 Till I am full reuenged for his death.   ·eaf030·

 _Edw._ Lord _Warwike_, I doe bend my knees with thine,
 And in that vow now ioine my soule to thee,
 Thou setter vp and puller downe of kings,
 vouchsafe a gentle victorie to vs,
 Or let vs die before we loose the daie:   [eaf035]

 _George._ Then let vs haste to cheere the souldiers harts,
 And call them pillers that will stand to vs,   [eaf037]
 And hiely promise to remunerate   [eaf038]
 Their trustie seruice, in these dangerous warres.

 _Rich._ Come, come awaie, and stand not to debate,   ·eaf040·
 For yet is hope of fortune good enough.
 Brothers, giue me your hands, and let vs part
 And take our leaues vntill we meet againe,
 Where ere it be in heauen or in earth.
 Now I that neuer wept, now melt in wo,   ·eaf045·
 To see these dire mishaps continue so.
 _Warwike_ farewel.

 _War._ Awaie awaie, once more sweet Lords farewell.
               _Exeunt Omnes._


SCENE VII.

Alarmes, and then enter _Richard_ at one dore and _Clifford_
at the other.

 _Rich._ A _Clifford_ a _Clifford_.

 _Clif._ A _Richard_ a _Richard_.

 _Rich._ Now _Clifford_, for _Yorke_ & young _Rutlands_ death,
 This thirsty sword that longs to drinke thy bloud,
 Shall lop thy limmes, and slise thy cursed hart,   [eag005]
 For to reuenge the murders thou hast made.

 _Clif._ Now _Richard_, I am with thee here alone,
 This is the hand that stabd thy father _Yorke_,
 And this the hand that slew thy brother _Rutland_,
 And heres the heart that triumphs in their deathes,   [eag010]
 And cheeres these hands that slew thy sire and brother,
 To execute the like vpon thy selfe,
 And so haue at thee.


SCENE VIII.

Alarmes. They fight, and then enters _Warwike_
and rescues _Richard_, & then _exeunt omnes_.

Alarme still, and then enter _Henry solus_.

 _Hen._ Oh gratious God of heauen looke downe on vs,
 And set some endes to these incessant griefes,
 How like a mastlesse ship vpon the seas,
 This woful battaile doth continue still,
 Now leaning this way, now to that side driue,   ·eah005·
 And none doth know to whom the daie will fall.
 O would my death might staie these ciuill iars!   [eah007]
 Would I had neuer raind, nor nere bin king,   [eah008]
 _Margret_ and _Clifford_, chide me from the fielde,
 Swearing they had best successe when _I_ was thence.   ·eah010·
 Would God that _I_ were dead so all were well,
 Or would my crowne suffice, I were content
 To yeeld it them and liue a priuate life.

    Enter a souldier with a dead man in his armes.

 _Sould_ Il blowes the wind that profits no bodie,
 _T_his man that I have slaine in fight to daie,   ·eah015·
 Maie be possessed of some store of crownes,
 And I will search to find them if I can,
 But stay. Me thinkes it is my fathers face,
 Oh I tis he whom I haue slaine in fight,
 From London was I prest out by the king,   ·eah020·
 My father he came on the part of _Yorke_,
 And in this conflict I haue slaine my father:
 Oh pardon God, I knew not what I did,
 And pardon father, for I knew thee not.   [eah024]

    Enter an other souldier with a dead man.

 _2. Soul._ Lie there thou that foughtst with me so stoutly,   ·eah025·
 Now let me see what store of gold thou haste,
 But staie, me thinkes this is no famous face:
 Oh no it is my sonne that _I_ haue slaine in fight,
 O monstrous times begetting such euents,
 How cruel bloudy, and ironious,   [eah030]
 This deadlie quarrell dailie doth beget,
 Poore boy thy father gaue thee lif too late,   [eah032]
 And hath bereau’de thee of thy life too sone.

 _King_ Wo aboue wo, griefe more then common griefe,
 Whilst Lyons warre and battaile for their dens,   ·eah035·
 Poore lambs do feele the rigor of their wraths:
 The red rose and the white are on his face,   [eah037]
 The fatall colours of our striuing houses,
 Wither one rose, and let the other flourish,
 For if you striue, ten thousand liues must perish.   ·eah040·

 _1. Sould._ How will my mother for my fathers death,
 Take on with me and nere be satisfide?

 _2. Sol._ How will my wife for slaughter of my son,   [eah043]
 Take on with me and nere be satisfide?

 _King._  How will the people now misdeeme their king,   ·eah045·
 Oh would my death their mindes could satisfie.

 _1. Sould._ Was euer son so rude his fathers bloud to spil?

 _2. Soul._ Was euer father so vnnaturall his son to kill?

 _King._ Was euer king thus greeud and vexed still?

 _1. Sould._ Ile beare thee hence from this accursed place,   ·eah050·
 For wo is me to see my fathers face.
               _Exit_ with his father.

 _2. Soul._ Ile beare thee hence & let them fight that wil,
 For _I_ haue murdered where I should not kill.   [eah053]
               _Exit_ with his sonne.

 _K Hen._ Weepe wretched man, Ile lay thee teare for tear,
 Here sits a king as woe begone as thee.   ·eah055·

    Alarmes and enter the _Queene_.

 _Queene._ Awaie my Lord to _Barwicke_ presentlie,
 The daie is lost, our friends are murdered,
 No hope is left for vs, therefore awaie.   [eah058]

    Enter prince _Edward_.

 _Prince._ Oh father flie, our men haue left the field,
 Take horse sweet father, let us saue our selues.   ·eah060·

    Enter _Exeter_.

 _Exet._ Awaie my Lord for vengeance comes along with him:   [eah061]
 Nay stand not to expostulate make hast,
 Or else come after, Ile awaie before.

 _K Hen._ Naie staie good _Exeter_, for Ile along with thee.

    Enter _Clifford_ wounded with an arrow in his necke.

 _Clif._ Heere burnes my candell out,   ·eah065·
 That whilst it lasted gaue king _Henry_ light.
 Ah _Lancaster_, I feare thine ouerthrow,
 More then my bodies parting from my soule.
 My loue and feare glude manie friendes to thee,
 And now _I_ die, that tough commixture melts.   ·eah070·
 Impairing _Henry_ strengthened misproud _Yorke_,
 The common people swarme like summer flies,
 And whither flies the Gnats but to the sun?   [eah073]
 And who shines now but _Henries_ enemie?
 Oh _Phœbus_ hadst thou neuer giuen consent,   ·eah075·
 That _Phæton_ should checke thy fierie steedes,
 Thy burning carre had neuer scorcht the earth.
 And _Henry_ hadst thou liu’d as kings should doe,
 And as thy father and his father did,
 Giuing no foot vnto the house of _Yorke_,   ·eah080·
 I and ten thousand in this wofull land,
 Had left no mourning Widdowes for our deathes,
 And thou this daie hadst kept thy throne in peace.
 For what doth cherish weedes but gentle aire?
 And what makes robbers bold but lenitie?   [eah085]
 Bootlesse are plaintes, and curelesse are my woundes,
 No waie to flie, no strength to hold our flight,
 The foe is mercilesse and will not pittie me,
 And at their hands _I_ haue deserude no pittie.
 The aire is got into my bleeding wounds,   ·eah090·
 And much effuse of bloud doth make me faint,
 Come _Yorke_, and _Richard_, _Warwike_ and the rest,
 _I_ stabde your fathers, now come split my brest.   [eah093]

    Enter _Edward_, _Richard_, and _Warwike_, and Souldiers.

 _Edw._ Thus farre our fortunes keepes an vpward   [eah094]
 Course, and we are grast with wreathes of victorie.   [eah095]
 Some troopes pursue the bloudie minded Queene,
 _T_hat now towards _Barwike_ doth poste amaine,
 But thinke you that _Clifford_ is fled awaie with them?

 _War._ No, tis impossible he should escape,
 _F_or though before his face I speake the words,   ·eah100·
 Your brother Richard markt him for the graue.
 And where so ere he be I warrant him dead.

    _Clifford_ grones and then dies.

 _Edw._ Harke, what soule is this that takes his heauy leaue?

 _Rich._ A deadlie grone, like life and deaths departure.

 _Edw._ See who it is, and now the battailes ended,   ·eah105·
 Friend or foe, let him be friendlie vsed.

 _Rich._ Reuerse that doome of mercie, for tis _Clifford_,
 Who kild our tender brother _Rutland_,
 And stabd our princelie father Duke of _Yorke_.   [eah109]

 _War._ From off the gates of _Yorke_ fetch down the   [eah110]
 Head, Your fathers head which _Clifford_ placed there.
 Insteed of that, let his supplie the roome.   [eah112]
 Measure for measure must be answered.

 _Edw._ Bring forth that fatall scrichowle to our house,
 That nothing sung to vs but bloud and death,   ·eah115·
 Now his euill boding tongue no more shall speake.   [eah116]

 _War._ I thinke his vnderstanding is bereft.
 Say _Clifford_, doost thou know who speakes to thee?
 Darke cloudie death oreshades his beames of life,
 And he nor sees nor heares vs what we saie.   ·eah120·

 _Rich._ Oh would he did, and so perhaps he doth,
 And tis his policie that in the time of death,   [eah122]
 He might auoid such bitter stormes as he
 In his houre of death did give vnto our father.

 _George._ _Richard_ if thou thinkest so, vex him with eager
               words.   ·eah125·

 _Rich._ _Clifford_, aske mercie and obtaine no grace.

 _Edw._ _Clifford_, repent in bootlesse penitence.

 _War._ _Clifford_ deuise excuses for thy fault.

 _George._ Whilst we deuise fell tortures for thy fault.

 _Rich._ Thou pittiedst _Yorke_, and I am sonne to _Yorke_.   ·eah130·

 _Edw._ Thou pittiedst _Rutland_, and I will pittie thee.

 _George._ Wheres captaine _Margaret_ to fence you now?   [eah132]

 _War._ They mocke thee _Clifford_, sweare as thou wast wont.

 _Rich._ What not an oth? Nay, then _I_ know hees dead.   [eah134]
 Tis hard, when _Clifford_ cannot foord his friend an oath.   ·eah135·
 By this I know hees dead, and by my soule,
 Would this right hand buy but an howres life,
 That I in all contempt might raile at him.
 Ide cut it off and with the issuing bloud,
 Stifle the villaine whose instanched thirst,   ·eah140·
 _Yorke_ and young _Rutland_ could not satisfie.

 _War._ _I_, but he is dead, off with the traitors head,
 And reare it in the place your fathers stands.
 And now to London with triumphant march,
 There to be crowned _Englands_ lawfull king.   ·eah145·
 From thence shall _Warwike_ crosse the seas to _France_,
 And aske the ladie _Bona_ for thy _Queene_,
 So shalt thou sinew both these landes togither,
 And hauing _France_ thy friend thou needst not dread,   [eah149]
 The scattered foe that hopes to rise againe.   ·eah150·
 And though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
 Yet looke to haue them busie to offend thine eares.
 First He see the coronation done,
 And afterward He crosse the seas to _France_,
 To effect this marriage if it please my Lord   [eah155]

 _Edw._ Euen as thou wilt good _Warwike_ let it be.
 But first before we goe, _George_ kneele downe.
 We here create thee Duke of _Clarence_, and girt thee with the
               sword.   [eah158]
 Our younger brother _Richard_ Duke of _Glocester_.   [eah159]
 _Warwike_ as my selfe shal do & vndo as him pleaseth best.   [eah160]

 _Rich._ Let me be Duke of _Clarence_, _George_ of _Gloster_,
 For _Glosters_ Dukedome is too ominous.

 _War._ Tush thats a childish obseruation.   [eah163]
 _Richard_ be Duke of _Gloster_.  Now to London.
 To see these honors in possession.      _Exeunt Omnes._   ·eah165·


SCENE IX.

Enter two keepers with bow and arrowes.

 _Keeper._ Come, lets take our stands vpon this hill,
 And by and by the deere will come this waie.
 But staie, heere comes a man, lets listen him a while.

    Enter king _Henrie_ disguisde.

 _Hen._ From _Scotland_ am I stolne euen of pure loue,
 And thus disguisde to greet my natiue land.   ·eai005·
 No, _Henrie_ no, _I_t is no land of thine,
 No bending knee will call thee _Cæsar_ now,
 No humble suters sues to thee for right,
 For how canst thou helpe them and not thy selfe?

 _Keeper._ I marrie sir, here is a deere, his skin is a   [eai010]
 Keepers fee. Sirra stand close, for as I thinke,
 This is the king, king _Edward_ hath deposde.

 _Hen._ My _Queene_ and sonne poore soules are gone to   [eai013]
 _France_, and as I heare the great commanding _Warwike_,
 To intreat a marriage with the ladie _Bona_,   ·eai015·
 If this be true, poore _Queene_ and sonne,
 Your labour is but spent in vaine,
 For _Lewis_ is a prince soone wun with words,   [eai018]
 And _Warwike_ is a subtill Orator.
 He laughes and saies, his Edward is instalde,
 She weepes, and saies her _Henry_ is deposde,
 He on his right hand asking a wife for _Edward_,
 She on his left side crauing aid for _Henry_.

 _Keeper._ What art thou that talkes of kings and queens?   [eai024]

 _Hen._ More then I seeme, for lesse I should not be.   ·eai025·
 A man at least, and more I cannot be,
 And men maie talke of kings, and why not I?

 _Keeper._ I but thou talkest as if thou wert a king thy
               selfe.   [eai028]

 _Hen._ Why so I am in mind though not in shew.   [eai029]

 _Keeper._ And if thou be a king where is thy crowne?   ·eai030·

 _Hen._ My crowne is in my hart, not on my head.
 My crowne is calde content, a crown that   [eai032]
 Kings doe seldome times enioy.

 _Keeper._ And if thou be a king crownd with content,
 Your crowne content and you, must be content   ·eai035·
 To go with vs vnto the officer, for as we thinke
 You are our quondam king, _K. Edward_ hath deposde,   [eai037]
 And therefore we charge you in Gods name & the kings
 To go along with vs vnto the officers.

 _Hen._ Gods name be fulfild, your kings name be   [eai040]
 Obaide, and be you kings, command and Ile obay.
               _Exeunt Omnes._


SCENE X.

Enter king _Edward_, _Clarence_, and _Gloster_, _Montague_,
_Hastings_, and the Lady _Gray_.

 _K Edw._ Brothers of _Clarence_, and of _Glocester_,   [eaj001]
 This ladies husband heere sir _Richard Gray_,
 At the battaile of saint Albones did lose his life,   [eaj003]
 His lands then were seazed on by the conqueror.
 Her sute is now to repossesse those lands,   ·eaj005·
 And sith in quarrell of the house of _Yorke_,
 The noble gentleman did lose his life,
 In honor we cannot denie her sute.

 _Glo._ Your highnesse shall doe well to grant it then.

 _K Edw_ I, so _I_ will, but yet Ile make a pause.   ·eaj010·

 _Glo._ I, is the winde in that doore?

 _Clarence,_ I see the Lady hath some thing to grant,   [eaj012]
 Before the king will grant her humble sute.

 _Cla._ He knowes the game, how well he keepes the wind.   [eaj014]

 _K. Ed._ Widow come some other time to know our mind.   ·eaj015·

 _La._ May it please your grace _I_ cannot brooke delaies,
 I beseech your highnesse to dispatch me now.

 _K Ed._ Lords giue vs leaue, wee meane to trie this widowes wit.

 _Cla._ I, good leaue haue you.

 _Glo._ For you will haue leaue till youth take leaue,   ·eaj020·
 And leaue you to your crouch.

 _K Ed._ Come hither widdow, howe many children haste thou?

 _Cla._ I thinke he meanes to begge a child on her.

 _Glo._ Nay whip me then, heele rather giue hir two.   [eaj024]

 _La._ Three my most gratious Lord.   [eaj025]

 _Glo._ You shall haue foure and you wil be rulde by him.   [eaj026]

 _K Ed._ Were it not pittie they shoulde loose their fathers
               lands?   [eaj027]

 _La._ Be pittifull then dread L. and grant it them.   [eaj028]

 _K Edw._ Ile tell thee how these lands are to be got.

 _La._ So shall you bind me to your highnesse seruice.   ·eaj030·

 _K Ed._ What seruice wilt thou doe me if I grant it them?

 _La._ Euen what your highnesse shall command.

 _Glo._ Naie then widow Ile warrant you all your   [eaj033]
 Husbands lands, if you grant to do what he
 Commands. Fight close or in good faith   ·eaj035·
 You catch a clap.

 _Cla._ Naie I feare her not vnlesse she fall.

 _Glo._ Marie godsforbot man, for heele take vantage then.   [eaj038]

 _La._ Why stops my Lord, shall I not know my taske?

 _K Ed._ An easie taske, tis but to loue a king.   ·eaj040·

 _La._ Thats soone performde, because I am a subiect.   [eaj041]

 _K Ed._ Why then thy husbandes landes _I_ freelie giue thee.

 _La._ I take my leaue with manie thousand thankes.

 _Cla._ The match is made, shee seales it with a cursie.   [eaj044]

 _K Ed._ Staie widdow staie, what loue dost thou thinke
 I sue so much to get?

 _La._ My humble seruice, such as subiects owes and the lawes commands.

 _K Ed._ No by my troth, I meant no such loue,   [eaj048]
 But to tell thee the troth, I aime to lie with thee.

 _La._ To tell you plaine my Lord, I had rather lie in
               prison,   ·eaj050·

 _K Edw._ Why then thou canst not get thy husbandes lands.

 _La._ Then mine honestie shall be my dower,
 For by that losse I will not purchase them.

 _K Ed._ Herein thou wrongst thy children mightilie.

 _La._ Heerein your highnesse wrongs both them and   [eaj055]
 Me, but mightie Lord this merrie inclination
 Agrees not with the sadnesse of my sute.
 Please it your highnes to dismisse me either with _I_ or no.

 _K Ed._ _I_, if thou saie _I_ to my request,
 No, if thou saie no to my demand.   ·eaj060·

 _La._ Then no my Lord, my sute is at an end.

 _Glo._ The widdow likes him not, shee bends the brow.   [eaj062]

 _Cla._ Why he is the bluntest woer in christendome.

 _K Ed._ Her lookes are all repleat with maiestie,
 One waie or other she is for a king,   ·eaj065·
 And she shall be my loue or else my _Queene_.
 Saie that king _Edward_ tooke thee for his _Queene_.

 _La._ Tis better said then done, my gratious Lord,
 _I_ am a subiect fit to iest withall,
 But far vnfit to be a Soueraigne.   ·eaj070·

 _K Edw._ Sweet widdow, by my state I sweare, _I_ speake   [eaj071]
 No more then what my hart intends,
 And that is to enioie thee for my loue.

 _La._ And that is more then I will yeeld vnto,
 _I_ know _I_ am too bad to be your _Queene_,   [eaj075]
 And yet too good to be your Concubine.   [eaj076]

 _K Edw._ You cauill widdow, I did meane my _Queene_.

 _La._ Your grace would be loath my sonnes should call you father.

 _K Edw._ No more then when my daughters call thee   [eaj079]
 Mother. Thou art a widow and thou hast some children,   ·eaj080·
 And by Gods mother _I_ being but a bacheler
 Haue other some. Why tis a happy thing
 To be the father of manie children.
 Argue no more, for thou shall be my Queene.

 _Glo._ The ghostlie father now hath done his shrift.   ·eaj085·

 _Cla._  When he was made a shriuer twas for shift.   [eaj086]

 _K. Edw._ Brothers, you muse what talke the widdow   [eaj087]
 And _I_ haue had, you would thinke it strange
 If _I_ should marrie her.

 _Cla._ Marrie her my Lord, to whom?   ·eaj090·

 _K Edw._ Why _Clarence_ to my selfe.

 _Glo._ That would be ten daies wonder at the least.

 _Cla._ Why thats a daie longer then a wonder lastes.   [eaj093]

 _Glo._ And so much more are the wonders in extreames

 _K Edw._ Well ieast on brothers, _I_ can tell you, hir   [eaj095]
 Sute is granted for her husbands lands.   [eaj096]

    Enter a Messenger.

 _Mes._ And it please your grace, _Henry_ your foe is   [eaj097]
 Taken, and brought as prisoner to your pallace gates.

 _K Edw._ Awaie with him, and send him to the Tower,
 And let vs go question with the man about   [eaj100]
 His apprehension. Lords along, and vse this
 Ladie honorablie.       _Exeunt Omnes._   [eaj102]

    _Manet Gloster_ and speakes.

 _Glost._ I, _Edward_ will vse women honourablie,
 Would he were wasted marrow, bones and all,
 That from his loines no issue might succeed   ·eaj105·
 To hinder me from the golden time _I_ looke for,
 For _I_ am not yet lookt on in the world.
 First is there _Edward_, _Clarence_, and _Henry_
 And his sonne, and all they lookt for issue   [eaj109]
 Of their loines ere _I_ can plant my selfe,   ·eaj110·
 A cold premeditation for my purpose,
 What other pleasure is there in the world beside?
 _I_ will go clad my bodie in gaie ornaments,
 And lull my selfe within a ladies lap,
 And witch sweet Ladies with my words and lookes.   ·eaj115·
 Oh monstrous man, to harbour such a thought!
 Why loue did scorne me in my mothers wombe.
 And for _I_ should not deale in hir affaires,   [eaj118]
 Shee did corrupt fraile nature in the flesh,
 And plaste an enuious mountaine on my backe,   [eaj120]
 Where sits deformity to mocke my bodie,
 To drie mine arme vp like a withered shrimpe.
 To make my legges of an vnequall size,
 And am _I_ then a man to be belou’d?
 Easier for me to compasse twentie crownes.   ·eaj125·
 Tut _I_ can smile, and murder when _I_ smile,
 _I_ crie content, to that that greeues me most.   [eaj127]
 _I_ can adde colours to the Camelion,
 And for a need change shapes with _Protheus_,
 And set the aspiring _Catalin_ to schoole.   ·eaj130·
 Can _I_ doe this, and cannot get the crowne?   [eaj131]
 Tush were it ten times higher, _I_le pull it downe.      _Exit._


SCENE XI.

Enter king _Lewis_ and the ladie _Bona_, and _Queene Margaret_, _Prince
Edward_, and _Oxford_ and others.

 _Lewis._ Welcome _Queene_ Margaret to the Court of _France_,   [eak001]
 _I_t fits not _Lewis_ to sit while thou dost stand,
 Sit by my side, and here _I_ vow to thee,
 Thou shalt haue aide to repossesse thy right,
 And beat proud Edward from his vsurped seat.   ·eak005·
 And place king _Henry_ in his former rule.

 _Queen._ _I_ humblie thanke your royall maiestie.
 And pray the God of heauen to blesse thy state,
 Great king of _France_, that thus regards our wrongs.

    Enter _Warwike_.

 _Lew._ How now, who is this?   ·eak010·

 _Queen._ Our Earle of _Warwike_ Edwardes chiefest friend.

 _Lew._ Welcome braue _Warwike_, what brings thee to France?

 _War._ From worthy Edward king of _England_,
 My Lord and Soueraigne and thy vowed friend,
 _I_ come in kindnes and vnfained loue,   ·eak015·
 First to do greetings to thy royall person,
 And then to craue a league of amitie,
 And lastlie to confirme that amitie
 With nuptiall knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
 That vertuous ladie _Bona_ thy faire sister,   ·eak020·
 To Englands king in lawfull marriage.

 _Queen._ And if this go forward all our hope is done.

 _War._ And gratious Madam, in our kings behalfe,
 I am commanded with your loue and fauour,
 Humblie to kisse your hand and with my tongue,   ·eak025·
 To tell the passions of my soueraines hart,
 Where fame late entring at his heedfull eares,
 Hath plast thy glorious image and thy vertues.   [eak028]

 _Queen._ King _Lewes_ and Lady _Bona_ heare me speake,
 Before you answere _Warwike_ or his words,   ·eak030·
 For hee it is hath done vs all these wrongs.

 _War._ Iniurious _Margaret_.

 _Prince Ed._ And why not Queene?

 _War._ Because thy father _Henry_ did vsurpe,
 And thou no more art Prince then shee is Queene.   ·eak035·

 _Ox._ Then _Warwike_ disanuls great _Iohn_ of _Gaunt_,
 That did subdue the greatest part of _Spaine_,
 And after _Iohn_ of _Gaunt_ wise _Henry_ the fourth,
 Whose wisedome was a mirrour to the world.
 And after this wise prince _Henry_ the fift,   ·eak040·
 Who with his prowesse conquered all _France_,
 From these our _Henries_ lineallie discent.   [eak042]

 _War._ _Oxford_, how haps that in this smooth discourse
 You told not how _Henry_ the sixt had lost
 All that _Henry_ the fift had gotten.   ·eak045·
 Me thinkes these peeres of _France_ should smile at that,
 But for the rest you tell a pettigree   [eak047]
 Of threescore and two yeares a sillie time,   [eak048]
 To make prescription for a kingdomes worth.

 _Oxf._ Why _Warwike_, canst thou denie thy king,   ·eak050·
 Whom thou obeyedst thirtie and eight yeeres,
 And bewray thy treasons with a blush?

 _War._  Can _Oxford_ that did euer fence the right,
 Now buckler falshood with a pettigree?
 For shame leaue _Henry_ and call _Edward_ king.   ·eak055·

 _Oxf._  Call him my king by whom mine elder   [eak056]
 Brother the Lord _Awbray Vere_ was done to death,
 And more then so, my father euen in the
 Downefall of his mellowed yeares,
 When age did call him to the dore of death?   ·eak060·
 No _Warwike_ no, whilst life vpholds this arme
 This arme vpholds the house of _Lancaster_.

 _War._ And I the house of _Yorke_.

 _K Lewes._ Queene _Margaret_, prince _Edward_ and   [eak064]
 _Oxford_, vouchsafe to forbeare a while,   ·eak065·
 Till I doe talke a word with _Warwike_.
 Now Warwike euen vpon thy honor tell me true;
 Is _Edward_ lawfull king or no?
 For I were loath to linke with him, that is not lawful heir.

 _War._ Thereon _I_ pawne mine honour and my credit.   ·eak070·

 _Lew._ What is he gratious in the peoples eies?   [eak071]

 _War._ The more, that _Henry_ is vnfortunate.

 _Lew._ What is his loue to our sister _Bona_?   [eak074]

 _War._ Such it seemes
 As maie beseeme a monarke like himselfe.   ·eak075·
 My selfe haue often heard him saie and sweare,
 That this his loue was an eternall plant,
 The root whereof was fixt in vertues ground,
 The leaues and fruite maintainde with beauties sun,
 Exempt from enuie, but not from disdaine,   ·eak080·
 Vnlesse the ladie _Bona_ quite his paine.

 _Lew._ Then sister let vs heare your firme resolue.

 _Bona._ Your grant or your denial shall be mine,   [eak083]
 But ere this daie _I_ must confesse, when I
 Haue heard your kings deserts recounted,   ·eak085·
 Mine eares haue tempted iudgement to desire.

 _Lew._ Then draw neere Queene _Margaret_ and be a   [eak087]
 Witnesse, that _Bona_ shall be wife to the English king.

 _Prince Edw._ To _Edward_, but not the English king.

 _War._ _Henry_ now liues in _Scotland_ at his ease,   ·eak090·
 Where hauing nothing, nothing can he lose,
 And as for you your selfe our _quondam_ Queene,
 You haue a father able to mainetaine your state,
 And better twere to trouble him then _France_.   [eak094]

    Sound for a post within.

 _Lew._ Here comes some post _Warwike_ to thee or vs.   ·eak095·

 _Post._ My Lord ambassador this letter is for you,
 Sent from your brother Marquis _Montague_.
 This from our king vnto your Maiestie.
 And these to you Madam, from whom I know not.

 _Oxf._ I like it well that our faire Queene and mistresse,   ·eak100·
 Smiles at her newes when _Warwike_ frets as his.   [eak101]

 _P. Ed._ And marke how _Lewes_ stamps as he were nettled.

 _Lew._ Now _Margaret_ & _Warwike_, what are your news?

 _Queen._ Mine such as fils my hart full of ioie.   [eak104]

 _War._ Mine full of sorrow and harts discontent.   ·eak105·

 _Lew._ What hath your king married the Ladie _Gray_,
 And now to excuse himselfe sends vs a post of papers?
 How dares he presume to vse vs thus?

 _Quee._ This proueth _Edwards_ loue, & _Warwiks_ honesty.

 _War._ King _Lewis,_ I here protest in sight of heauen,   ·eak110·
 And by the hope _I_ haue of heauenlie blisse,
 That I am cleare from this misdeed of _Edwards_.
 No more my king, for he dishonours me,
 And most himselfe, if he could see his shame.
 Did I forget that by the house of _Yorke_,   ·eak115·
 My father came vntimelie to his death?   [eak116]
 Did _I_ let passe the abuse done to my neece?   [eak117]
 Did I impale him with the regall Crowne,
 And thrust king _Henry_ from his natiue home,   [eak119]
 And most vngratefull doth he vse me thus?   ·eak120·
 My gratious _Queene_ pardon what is past,
 And henceforth I am thy true seruitour,
 I will reuenge the wrongs done to ladie _Bona_,
 And replant _Henry_ in his former state.

 _Queen._ Yes _Warwike_ I doe quite forget thy former   [eak125]
 Faults, if now thou wilt become king _Henries_ friend.

 _War._ So much his friend, I his vnfained friend,
 That if king _Lewes_ vouchsafe to furnish vs
 With some few bands of chosen souldiers,
 Ile vndertake to land them on our coast,   ·eak130·
 And force the Tyrant from his seate by warre,
 Tis not his new made bride shall succour him.

 _Lew._ Then at the last I firmelie am resolu’d,
 You shall haue aide: and English messenger returne   [eak134]
 In post, and tell false _Edward_ thy supposed king,
 That _Lewis_ of France is sending ouer Maskers
 To reuell it with him and his new bride.

 _Bona._ Tell him in hope heele be a Widower shortlie,   [eak138]
 Ile weare the willow garland for his sake.

 _Queen._ Tell him my mourning weedes be laide aside,   ·eak140·
 And I am readie to put armour on.

 _War._ Tell him from me, that he hath done me wrong,
 And therefore Ile vncrowne him er’t be long.
 Thears thy reward, begone.   [eak144]

 _Lew._ But now tell me _Warwike_, what assurance   ·eak145·
 _I_ shall haue of thy true loyaltie?

 _War._ This shall assure my constant loyaltie,
 If that our Queene and this young prince agree,
 Ile ioine mine eldest daughter and my ioie
 To him forthwith in holie wedlockes bandes.   [eak150]

 _Queen._ Withall my hart, that match _I_ like full wel,   [eak151]
 Loue her sonne _Edward_, shee is faire and yong,
 And giue thy hand to _Warwike_ for thy loue.

 _Lew._ _I_t is enough, and now we will prepare,
 To lcuie souldiers for to go with you.   [eak155]
 And you Lord _Bourbon_ our high Admirall,
 Shall waft them safelie to the English coast,
 And chase proud _Edward_ from his slumbring trance,
 For mocking marriage with the name of _France_.

 _War._ _I_ came from _Edward_ as Imbassadour   [eak160]
 But I returne his sworne and mortall foe:
 Matter of marriage was the charge he gaue me,
 But dreadfull warre shall answere his demand.
 Had he none else to make a stale but me?
 Then none but I shall turne his iest to sorrow.   ·eak165·
 _I_ was the chiefe that raisde him to the crowne,
 And _I_le be chiefe to bring him downe againe,
 Not that I pittie _Henries_ miserie,
 But seeke reuenge on _Edwards_ mockerie.      _Exit._


SCENE XII.

Enter king _Edward_, the _Queene_ and _Clarence_, and _Gloster_, and
_Montague_, and _Hastings_, and _Penbrooke_ with souldiers.

 _Edw._ Brothers of _Clarence_, and of _Glocester_,   [eal001]
 What thinke you of our marriage with the ladie _Gray_?

 _Cla._ My Lord, we thinke as _Warwike_ and _Lewes_
 That are so slacke in iudgement, that theile take   [eal004]
 No offence at this suddaine marriage.   ·eal005·

 _Edw._ Suppose they doe, they are but _Lewes_ and   [eal006]
 _Warwike_, and I am your king and _Warwikes_,   [eal007]
 And will be obaied.

 _Glo._ And shall, because our king, but yet such   [eal009]
 Sudden marriages seldome proueth well.   [eal010]

 _Edw._ Yea brother _Richard_ are you against vs too?

 _Glo._ Not _I_ my Lord, no, God forefend that I should   [eal012]
 Once gaine saie your highnesse pleasure,   [eal013]
 I, & twere a pittie to sunder them that yoake so wel
               togi- (ther.   [eal014]

 _Edw._ Setting your skornes and your dislikes aside,   ·eal015·
 Shew me some reasons why the Ladie _Gray_,
 Maie not be my loue and Englands _Queene_?
 Speake freelie _Clarence_, _Gloster_,   [eal018]
 _Montague_ and _Hastings_.

 _Cla._ My Lord then this is my opinion,   [eal020]
 That _Warwike_ beeing dishonored in his embassage,
 Doth seeke reuenge to quite his iniuries.   [eal022]

 _Glo._ And _Lewes_ in regard of his sisters wrongs,
 Doth ioine with _Warwike_ to supplant your state,

 _Edw._ Suppose that _Lewis_ and _Warwike_ be appeasd,   ·eal025·
 By such meanes as I can best deuise.   [eal026]

 _Mont._ But yet to have ioind with France in this
 Alliance, would more haue strengthened this our
 Common wealth, gainst forraine stormes,   [eal029]
 Then anie home bred marriage.   [eal030]

 _Hast._ Let England be true within it selfe,
 We need not France nor any alliance with them.

 _Cla._ For this one speech the Lord _Hastings_ wel deserues,
 To haue the daughter and heire of the Lord _Hungerford_.

 _Edw._ And what then? It was our will it should be so?   [eal035]

 _Cla._ I, and for such a thing too the Lord _Scales_
 Did well deserue at your hands, to haue the
 Daughter of the Lord _Bonfield_, and left your
 Brothers to go seeke elsewhere, but in   [eal039]
 Your madnes, you burie brotherhood.   [eal040]

 _Edw._ Alasse poore _Clarence_, is it for a wife,
 That thou art mal-content,   [eal042]
 Why man be of good cheere, Ile prouide thee one.   [eal043]

 _Cla._ Naie you plaide the broker so ill for your selfe,
 That you shall giue me leaue to make my   [eal045]
 Choise as I thinke good, and to that intent,
 I shortlie meane to leaue you.

 _Edw._ Leaue me or tarrie I am full resolu’d,
 _Edward_ will not be tied to his brothers wils.

 _Queen._ My Lords doe me but right, and you must   [eal050]
 Confesse, before it pleasd his highnesse to aduance
 My state to title of a Queene,
 That I was not ignoble in my birth.   [eal053]

 _Edw._ Forbeare my loue to fawne upon their frownes,
 For thee they must obay, naie shall obaie,   ·eal055·
 And if they looke for fauour at my hands.

 _Mont._ My Lord, heere is the messenger returned from
               (France.   [eal057]

    Enter a Messenger.

 _Ed._ Now sirra, What letters or what newes?   [eal058]

 _Mes._ No letters my Lord, and such newes, as without
 your highnesse speciall pardon I dare not relate.   [eal060]

 _Edw._ We pardon thee, and as neere as thou canst   [eal061]
 Tell me, What said _Lewis_ to our letters?

 _Mes._ At my departure these were his verie words.
 Go tell false _Edward_ thy supposed king,
 That _Lewis_ of France is sending ouer Maskers,   ·eal065·
 To reuill it with him and his new bride.   [eal066]

 _Edw._ Is _Lewis_ so braue, belike he thinkes me _Henry_.   [eal067]
 But what said Lady _Bona_ to these wrongs?

 _Mes._ Tel him quoth she, in hope heele prove a widdower   [eal069]
 shortly, _I_le wear the willow garland for his sake.   [eal070]

 _Edw._ She had the wrong, indeed she could saie   [eal071]
 Little lesse. But what saide _Henries_ Queene, for as   [eal072]
 _I_ heare, she was then in place?

 _Mes._ Tell him quoth shee my mourning weeds be
 Doone, and I am readie to put armour on.   [eal075]

 _Edw._ Then belike she meanes to plaie the _Amazon_.
 But what said _Warwike_ to these iniuries?

 _Mes._ He more incensed then the rest my Lord,
 Tell him quoth he, that he hath done me wrong,
 And therefore Ile vncrowne him er’t be long.   ·eal080·

 _Ed._ Ha, Durst the traytor breath out such proude words?
 But I will arme me to preuent the worst.
 But what is _Warwike_ friendes with _Margaret_?   [eal083]

 _Mes._ I my good Lord, theare so linkt in friendship,   [eal084]
 That young Prince _Edward_ marries _Warwikes_ daughter.   ·eal085·

 _Cla._ The elder, belike _Clarence_ shall haue the   [eal086]
 Yonger. All you that loue me and _Warwike_   [eal087]
 Follow me.      _Exit Clarence_ and _Summerset._

 _Edw._ _Clarence_ and _Summerset_ fled to _Warwike_,
 What saie you brother _Richard_, will you stand to vs?   ·eal090·

 _Glo._ _I_ my Lord, in despight of all that shall   [eal091]
 Withstand you  For why hath Nature
 Made me halt downe right, but that I
 Should be valiant and stand to it, for if   [eal094]
 I would, _I_ cannot runne awaie.   ·eal095·

 _Edw._ _Penbrooke_, go raise an armie presentlie,
 Pitch vp my tent, for in the field this night
 I meane to rest, and on the morrow morne,
 Ile march to meet proud _Warwike_ ere he land
 Those stragling troopes which he hath got in France.   ·eal100·
 But ere I goe _Montague_ and _Hastings_,
 You of all the rest are neerest allied   [eal102]
 In bloud to _Warwike_, therefore tell me, if   [eal103]
 You fauour him more then me or not:
 Speake truelie, for I had rather haue you open   [eal105]
 Enemies, then hollow friends.

 _Monta._ So God helpe _Montague_ as he proues true.

 _Hast._ And _Hastings_ as hee fauours _Edwards_ cause.

 Edw. It shall suffice, come then lets march awaie.   [eal109]
               _Exeunt Omnes._


SCENE XIII.

Enter _Warwike_ and _Oxford_, with souldiers.

 _War._ Trust me my Lords all hitherto goes well,
 The common people by numbers swarme to vs,
 But see where _Sommerset_ and _Clarence_ comes,
 Speake suddenlie my Lords, are we all friends?   [eam004]

 _Cla._ Feare not that my Lord.   ·eam005·

 _War._ Then gentle _Clarence_ welcome vnto _Warwike_.
 And welcome _Summerset_, I hold it cowardise,
 To rest mistrustfull where a noble hart,   [eam008]
 Hath pawnde an open hand in signe of loue,
 Else might I thinke that _Clarence_, _Edwards_ brother,   ·eam010·
 Were but a fained friend to our proceedings,
 But welcome sweet _Clarence_ my daughter shal be thine.   [eam012]
 And now what rests but in nights couerture,
 Thy brother being careleslie encampt,
 His souldiers lurking in the towne about,   ·eam015·
 And but attended by a simple guarde,
 We maie surprise and take him at our pleasure,
 Our skouts have found the aduenture very easie,
 Then crie king _Henry_ with resolued mindes,
 And breake we presentlie into his tent.   ·eam020·

 _Cla._ Why then lets on our waie in silent sort,
 For _Warwike_ and his friends God and saint _George_.   [eam022]

 _War._ This is his tent, and see where his guard doth   [eam023]
 Stand, Courage my souldiers, now or neuer,
 But follow me now, and _Edward_ shall be ours.   ·eam025·

 _All._ A _Warwike_, a _Warwike_.

 _Oxf._ Who goes there?

 _War._ _Richard_ and _Hastings_ let them go, heere is the (Duke

 _Edw._ The Duke, why _Warwike_ when we parted   [eam029]
 Last, thou caldst me king?   [eam030]

 _War._ I, but the case is altred now.
 When you disgraste me in my embassage,   [eam032]
 Then _I_ disgraste you from being king,
 And now am come to create you Duke of _Yorke_,
 Alasse how should you gouerne anie kingdome,   ·eam035·
 That knowes not how to vse embassadors,
 Nor how to vse your brothers brotherlie,
 Nor how to shrowd your selfe from enimies.

 _Edw._ Well _Warwike_, let fortune doe her worst,
 _Edward_ in minde will beare himselfe a king.   ·eam040·

 _War._ Then for his minde be _Edward_ Englands king.
 But _Henry_ now shall weare the English crowne.
 Go conuaie him to our brother archbishop of _Yorke_,
 And when I haue fought with _Penbrooke_ & his followers,
 Ile come and tell thee what the ladie _Bona_ saies,   ·eam045·
 And so for a while farewell good Duke of _Yorke_.   [eam046]
               _Exeunt_ some with _Edward_.

 _Cla._ What followes now, all hithertoo goes well,   [eam047]
 But we must dispatch some letters to _France_,   [eam048]
 To tell the _Queene_ of our happy fortune,
 And bid hir come with speed to ioine with vs.   [eam050]

 _War._ _I_ thats the first thing that we have to doe,   [eam051]
 And free king _Henry_ from imprisonment,
 And see him seated in his regall throne,
 Come let vs haste awaie, and hauing past these cares,   [eam054]
 _I_le post to _Yorke_, and see how _Edward_ fares.   ·eam055·
               _Exeunt Omnes._


SCENE XIV.

Enter _Gloster_, _Hastings_, and sir _William Stanly_.

 _Glo._ Lord Hastings, and sir William Stanly,   [ean001]
 Know that the cause _I_ sent for you is this.
 _I_ looke my brother with a slender traine,
 Should come a hunting in this forrest heere.
 The Bishop of _Yorke_ befriends him much,   ·ean005·
 And lets him vse his pleasure in the chase,
 Now I haue priuilie sent him word,
 How _I_ am come with you to rescue him,
 And see where the huntsman and he doth come.

    Enter _Edward_ and a Huntsman.

 _Hunts_ This waie my Lord the deere is gone.   ·ean010·

 _Edw._ No this waie huntsman, see where the   [ean011]
 Keepers stand. Now brother and the rest,
 What, are you prouided to depart?

 _Glo._ _I_, _I_, the horse stands at the parke corner,
 Come, to Linne, and so take shipping into _Flanders_.   ·ean015·

 _Edw._ Come then: _Hastings_, and _Stanlie_, _I_ will   [ean016]
 Requite your loues. Bishop farewell,
 Sheeld thee from _Warwikes_ frowne,   [ean018]
 And praie that I maie repossesse the crowne.
 Now huntsman what will you doe?   ·ean020·

 _Hunts_ Marrie my Lord, I thinke _I_ had as good
 Goe with you, as tarrie heere to be hangde.

 _Edw._ Come then lets awaie with speed.

SCENE XV.

Enter the _Queene_ and the Lord _Riuers_.

 _Riuers._ Tel me good maddam, why is your grace   [eao001]
 So passionate of late?

 _Queen._ Why brother _Riuers_, heare you not the newes,   [eao003]
 Of that successe king _Edward_ had of late?

 _Riu._ What? losse of some pitcht battaile against
               _Warwike_,   [eao005]
 Tush, feare not faire _Queen_, but cast those cares aside.
 King _Edwards_ noble mind his honours doth display:
 And _Warwike_ maie loose, though then he got the day.

 _Queen._ If that were all, my griefes were at an end:
 But greater troubles will I feare befall.   ·eao010·

 _Riu._ What, is he taken prisoner by the foe,   [eao011]
 To the danger of his royall person then?

 _Queen._ I, thears my griefe, king _Edward_ is surprisde,   [eao013]
 And led awaie, as prisoner vnto _Yorke_.   [eao014]

 _Riu._ The newes is passing strange, I must confesse:   [eao015]
 Yet comfort your selfe, for _Edward_ hath more friends,
 Then _Lancaster_ at this time must perceiue,
 That some will set him in his throne againe.

 _Queen._ God grant they maie, but gentle brother come,
 And let me leane vpon thine arme a while,   [eao020]
 Vntill I come vnto the sanctuarie,
 There to preserue the fruit within my wombe,

 And thats the cause we stand vpon our garde,   [eap006]
 And shut the gates for to preserue the towne.
 _Henry_ now is king, and we are sworne to him.

 _Edw._ Why my Lord Maire, if _Henry_ be your king,   [eap009]
 _Edward_ I am sure at least, is Duke of _Yorke_.   ·eap010·

 _Mair._ Truth my Lord, we know you for no lesse.   [eap011]

 _Edw._ I craue nothing but my Dukedome.

 _Rich._ But when the Fox hath gotten in his head,
 Heele quicklie make the bodie follow after.   [eap014]

 _Hast._ Why my Lord Maire, what stand you vpon points?   ·eap015·
 Open the gates, we are king _Henries_ friends.

 _Mair._ Saie you so, then _I_le open them presentlie.
               _Exit_ Maire.

 _Ri._ By my faith, a wise stout captain & soone perswaded.

    The Maire opens the dore, and brings the keies in his hand.

 _Edw._ So my Lord Maire, these gates must not be shut,   ·eap020·
 But in the time of warre, giue me the keies:   [eap021]
 What, feare not man for _Edward_ will defend
 the towne and you, despight of all your foes.

    Enter sir _Iohn Mountgommery_ with drumme and souldiers.

 How now _Richard_, who is this?

 _Rich._ Brother, this is sir Iohn _Mountgommery_,
 A trustie friend, vnlesse _I_ be deceiude.   ·eap025·

 _Edw._ Welcome sir Iohn. Wherfore come you in armes?

 _Sir Iohn._ To helpe king _Edward_ in this time of stormes,
 As euerie loyall subiect ought to doe.

 _Edw._ Thankes braue Mountgommery,
 But I onlie claime my Dukedom.   ·eap030·
 Vntil it please God to send the rest.   [eap031]

 _Sir Iohn._ Then fare you wel? Drum strike vp and let vs
 March away, I came to serue a king and not a Duke.

 _Edw._ Nay staie sir Iohn, and let vs first debate,
 With what security we maie doe this thing.   ·eap035·

 _Sir Iohn._ What stand you on debating, to be briefe,
 Except you presently proclaime your selfe our king,
 Ile hence againe, and keepe them backe that come to   [eap038]
 Succour you, why should we fight when
 You pretend no title?   ·eap040·

 _Rich._ Fie brother, fie, stand you vpon tearmes?   [eap041]
 Resolue your selfe, and let vs claime the crowne.

 _Edw._ _I_ am resolude once more to claime the crowne,
 And win it too, or else to loose my life.   [eap044]

 _Sir Iohn._ I now my soueraigne speaketh like himselfe,   [eap045]

 single fight, long liue _Edward_ the fourth.

 _All._ Long liue _Edward_ the fourth.

 _Edw._ We thanke you all. Lord Maire leade on the waie.
 For this night weele harbour here in _Yorke_,   [eap054]
 And then as earlie as the morning sunne,   ·eap055·
 Liftes vp his beames aboue this horison
 Weele march to London, to meete with _Warwike_:   [eap057]
 And pull false _Henry_ from the Regall throne.   [eap058]

 Againe, _Clarence_ and _Warwike_ doe you
 Keepe the crowne, and gouerne and protect
 My realme in peace, and I will spend the   ·eaq005·
 Remnant of my daies, to sinnes rebuke
 And my Creators praise.

 Make much of him my Lords,   [eaq020]
 For this is he shall helpe you more,
 Then you are hurt by me.

 _War._ What Counsell Lords, _Edward_ from _Belgia_,
 With hastie Germaines and blunt _Hollanders_,
 Is past in safetie through the narrow seas,   ·eaq025·
 And with his troopes doe march amaine towardes (London,
 And manie giddie people follow him.   [eaq027]

 _Oxf._ Tis best to looke to this betimes,
 For if this fire doe kindle any further,
 It will be hard for vs to quench it out.   ·eaq030·

 _War._ In _Warwike_shire _I_ haue true harted friends,
 Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in warre,
 Them will _I_ muster vp, and thou sonne _Clarence_ shalt   [eaq033]
 In _Essex_, _Suffolke_, _Norfolke_, and in _Kent_,
 Stir vp the knights and gentlemen to come with thee.   ·eaq035·

 And thou braue _Oxford_ wondrous well belou’d,
 Shalt in thy countries muster vp thy friends.   ·eaq040·

 Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduste,   [eas014]
 That we could haue no newes of their repaire?   ·eas015·

 _Edw._ Now _Warwike_ wilt thou be sorrie for thy faults,
 And call _Edward_ king and he will pardon thee.

 _War._ Naie rather wilt thou draw thy forces backe?
 Confesse who set thee vp and puld thee downe?
 Call _Warwike_ patron and be penitent,   [eas020]
 And thou shall still remaine the Duke of _Yorke_.

 _Glo._ I had thought at least he would haue said the king.
 Or did he make the iest against his will.   [eas023]

 _War._ Twas _Warwike_ gaue the kingdome to thy brother.   [eas024]

 _Edw._ Why then tis mine, if but by _Warwikes_ gift.   ·eas025·

 _War._ I but thou art no _Atlas_ for so great a waight,
 And weakling, _Warwike_ takes his gift againe,
 _Henry_ is my king, _Warwike_ his subiect.

 _Edw._ I prethe gallant _Warwike_ tell me this,
 What is the bodie when the head is off?   ·eas030·

 _Glo._ Alasse that _Warwike_ had no more foresight,   [eas031]
 But whilst he sought to steale the single ten,   [eas032]
 The king was finelie fingerd from the decke?   [eas033]
 You left poore _Henry_ in the Bishops pallace,
 And ten to one you’le meet him in the Tower.   [eas035]

 _Edw._ Tis euen so, and yet you are olde _Warwike_ still.

 _War._ O cheerefull colours, see where Oxford comes.   [eas037]

    Enter _Oxford_ with drum and souldiers & al crie,

 _Oxf._ Oxford, Oxford, for _Lancaster_.      _Exit._   [eas038]

    then _Clarence_ takes his red Rose out of his hat, and throwes it
    at _Warwike_.

 _War._ Com Clarence come, thou wilt if _Warwike_ call.   ·eas055·

 _Cla._ Father of _Warwike_, know you what this meanes?
 I throw mine infamie at thee,
 I will not ruinate my fathers house,
 Who gaue his bloud to lime the stones togither,
 And set vp _Lancaster_. Thinkest thou   ·eas060·
 That _Clarence_ is so harsh vnnaturall,
 To lift his sword against his brothers life,
 And so proud harted _Warwike_ I defie thee,
 And to my brothers turne my blushing cheekes?   [eas064]
 Pardon me _Edward_, for _I_ haue done amisse,   ·eas065·
 And _Richard_ doe not frowne vpon me,
 For henceforth I will proue no more vnconstant.

 _Edw._ Welcome _Clarence_, and ten times more welcome,
 Then if thou neuer hadst deserud our hate.   [eas069]

 _Glo._ Welcome good _Clarence_, this is brotherlie.   ·eas070·

 _War._ Oh passing traytor, periurd and vniust.

 _Edw._ Now _Warwike_, wilt thou leaue   [eas072]
 The towne and fight? or shall we beate the
 Stones about thine eares?

 _War._ Why _I_ am not coopt vppe heere for defence,   ·eas075·

 _I_ will awaie to Barnet presently,
 And bid thee battaile Edward if thou darest.   [eas077]

 _Edw._  Yes _Warwike_ he dares, and leades the waie,
 Lords to the field, saint _George_ and victorie.
               _Exeunt Omnes._


SCENE XX.

Alarmes, and then enter _Warwike_ wounded.

 _War._ Ah, who is nie? Come to me friend or foe,
 And tell me who is victor _Yorke_ or _Warwike_?
 Why aske I that? my mangled bodie shewes,
 That I must yeeld my bodie to the earth.
 And by my fall the conquest to my foes,   ·eat005·
 Thus yeelds the Cedar to the axes edge,
 Whose armes gaue shelter to the princelie Eagle,
 Vnder whose shade the ramping Lion slept,   [eat008]
 Whose top branch ouerpeerd Ioues spreading tree.
 The wrinkles in my browes now fild with bloud,   ·eat010·
 Were likened oft to kinglie sepulchers.
 For who liu’d king, but _I_ could dig his graue?
 And who durst smile, when _Warwike_ bent his brow?
 Lo now my glorie smeerd in dust and bloud,
 My parkes, my walkes, my mannors that _I_ had,   [eat015]
 Euen now forsake me, and of all my lands,
 Is nothing left me but my bodies length.

    Enter _Oxford_ and _Summerset._

 _Oxf._ Ah _Warwike_, _Warwike_, cheere vp thy selfe and liue,
 For yet thears hope enough to win the daie.   [eat019]
 Our warlike _Queene_ with troopes is come from _France_,   ·eat020·
 And at _South-hampton_ landed all hir traine,   [eat021]
 And mightst thou liue, then would we neuer flie.   [eat022]

 _War._ Whie then I would not flie, nor haue I now,
 But _Hercules_ himselfe must yeeld to ods,
 For manie wounds receiu’d, and manie moe repaid,   [eat025]
 Hath robd my strong knit sinews of their strength,
 And spite of spites needes must I yeeld to death.

 _Som._ Thy brother _Montague_ hath breathd his last,
 And at the pangs of death I heard him crie
 And saie, commend me to my valiant brother,   ·eat030·
 And more he would haue spoke and more he said,   [eat031]
 Which sounded like a clamor in a vault,   [eat032]
 That could not be distinguisht for the sound,
 And so the valiant _Montague_ gave vp the ghost.

 _War._ What is pompe, rule, raigne, but earth and dust?
 And liue we how we can, yet die we must.
 Sweet rest his soule, flie Lords and saue your selues,
 For _Warwike_ bids you all farewell to meet in Heauen.

    He dies.

 _Oxf_ Come noble _Summerset_, lets take our horse,   [eat039]
 And cause retrait be sounded through the campe,   [eat040]
 That all our friends that yet remaine aliue,
 Maie be awarn’d and saue themselues by flight.   [eat042]
 That done, with them weele post vnto the _Queene_,
 And once more trie our fortune in the field.   _Ex. ambo._   [eat044]

    Enter _Edward_, _Clarence_, _Gloster_, with souldiers.

 _Edw._ Thus still our fortune giues vs victorie,   ·eat045·
 And girts our temples with triumphant ioies,   [eat046]
 The bigboond traytor _Warwike_ hath breathde his last,   [eat047]
 And heauen this daie hath smilde vpon vs all,   [eat048]
 But in this cleere and brightsome daie,
 _I_ see a blacke suspitious cloud appeare   ·eat050·
 That will encounter with our glorious sunne
 Before he gaine his easefull westerne beames,
 I mean those powers which the _Queen_ hath got in _Frāce_   [eat053]
 Are landed, and meane once more to menace vs.

 _Glo._ _Oxford_ and _Summerset_ are fled to hir,   [eat055]
 And tis likelie if she haue time to breath,   [eat056]
 Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

 _Edw._ We are aduertisde by our louing friends,
 That they doe hold their course towards _Tewxburie_.
 Thither will we, for willingnes rids waie,   ·eat060·
 And in euerie countie as we passe along,   [eat061]
 Our strengthes shall be augmented.   [eat062]
 Come lets goe, for if we slacke this faire   [eat063]
 Bright Summers daie, sharpe winters
 Showers will marre our hope for haie.   _Ex. Omnes._   [eat065]


SCENE XXI.

Enter the _Queene_, _Prince Edward_, _Oxford_, and _Summerset_,
with drum and souldiers.

 _Quee._ Welcome to _England_, my louing friends of _Frāce_,   [eau001]
 And welcome _Summerset_, and _Oxford_ too.
 Once more haue we spread our sailes abroad,
 And though our tackling be almost consumde,
 And _Warwike_ as our maine mast ouerthrowne,   [eau005]
 Yet warlike Lords raise you that sturdie post,
 That beares the sailes to bring vs vnto rest,
 And _Ned_ and _I_ as willing Pilots should
 For once with carefull mindes guide on the sterne,
 To beare vs through that dangerous gulfe   ·eau010·
 That heretofore hath swallowed vp our friends.

 _Prince._ And if there be, as God forbid there should,
 Amongst vs a timorous or fearefull man,
 Let him depart before the battels ioine,   [eau014]
 Least he in time of need intise another,   [eau015]
 And so withdraw the souldiers harts from vs.
 _I_ will not stand aloofe and bid you fight,
 But with my sword presse in the thickest thronges,   [eau018]
 And single _Edward_ from his strongest guard,
 And hand to hand enforce him for to yeeld,   ·eau020·
 Or leaue my bodie as witnesse of my thoughts.

 _Oxf._ Women and children of so high resolue,
 And Warriors faint, why twere perpetuall   [eau023]
 Shame? Oh braue yong Prince, thy   [eau024]
 Noble grandfather doth liue againe in thee,   ·eau025·
 Long maiest thou liue to beare his image,
 And to renew his glories.

 _Sum._ And he that turnes and flies when such do fight,
 Let him to bed, and like the Owle by daie
 Be hist, and wondered at if he arise.   [eau030]

    Enter a Messenger.

 _Mes._ My Lords, Duke _Edward_ with a mighty power,
 Is marching hitherwards to fight with you.

 _Oxf._ I thought it was his pollicie, to take vs vnprouided,
 But here will we stand and fight it to the death.   [eau034]

    Enter king _Edward_, _Cla._ _Glo._ _Hast._ and Souldiers.

 _Edw._ See brothers, yonder stands the thornie wood,   ·eau035·
 Which by Gods assistance and your prowesse,
 Shall with our swords yer night be cleane cut downe.   [eau037]

 _Queen._ Lords, Knights & gentlemen, what _I_ should say,
 My teares gainesaie, for as you see, _I_ drinke
 The water of mine eies. Then no more   [eau040]
 But this. _Henry_ your king is prisoner   [eau041]
 In the tower, his land and all our friends
 Are quite distrest, and yonder standes
 The Wolfe that makes all this,
 Then on Gods name Lords togither cry saint _George_.   ·eau045·

 _All._ Saint _George_ for _Lancaster_.   [eau046]

    Alarmes to the battell, _Yorke_ flies, then the chambers be
    discharged. Then enter the king, _Cla._ & _Glo._ and the rest, &
    make a great shout, and crie, for _Yorke_, for _Yorke_, and then
    the _Queene_ is taken, & the prince, & _Oxf._ & _Sum._ and then
    sound and enter all againe.

 _Edw._ Lo here a period of tumultuous broiles,
 Awaie with Oxford to _Hames_ castell straight,
 For _Summerset_ off with his guiltie head.
 Awaie I will not heare them speake.   ·eau050·

 _Oxf._ For my part Ile not trouble thee with words.   [eau051]
               _Exit_ Oxford.

 _Sum._ Nor _I_, but stoope with patience to my death.   [eau052]
               _Exit Sum._

 _Edw._ Now _Edward_ what satisfaction canst thou make,
 For stirring vp my subiects to rebellion?

 _Prin._ Speake like a subiect proud ambitious Yorke,   ·eau055·
 Suppose that I am now my fathers mouth,
 Resigne thy chaire, and where _I_ stand kneele thou,
 Whilst _I_ propose the selfesame words to thee,   [eau058]
 Which traytor thou woudst haue me answere to.   [eau059]

 _Queen._ Oh that thy father had bin so resolu’d:   [eau060]

 _Glo._ That you might still haue kept your   [eau061]
 Peticote, and nere haue stolne the
 Breech from _Lancaster_.

 _Prince._ Let _Aesop_ fable in a winters night,
 His currish Riddles sorts not with this place.   ·eau065·

 _Glo._ By heauen brat _I_le plague you for that word.

 _Queen._ I, thou wast borne to be a plague to men.

 _Glo._ For Gods sake take awaie this captiue scold.

 _Prin_ Nay take away this skolding Crooktbacke rather.   [eau069]

 _Edw._ Peace wilfull boy, or _I_ will tame your tongue.   ·eau070·

 _Cla._ Vntuterd lad thou art too malepert.   [eau071]

 _Prin._ _I_ know my dutie, you are all vndutifull.
 Lasciuious _Edward_, and thou periurd _George_,
 And thou mishapen Dicke, I tell you all,
 I am your better, traytors as you be.   ·eau075·

 _Edw._ Take that, the litnes of this railer heere.   [eau076]

 _Queen._ Oh kill me too.

 _Glo._ Marrie and shall.

 _Edw._ Hold _Richard_ hold, for we haue doone too
                (much alreadie.   [eau079]

 _Glo._ Why should she liue to fill the world with words?   ·eau080·

 _Ed._ What doth she swound? make meanes for Her recouerie?   [eau081]

 _Glo._ _Clarence,_ excuse me to the king my brother,
 _I_ must to London on a serious matter,
 Ere you come there, you shall heare more newes.

 _Cla._ About what, prethe tell me?   ·eau085·

 _Glo._ The Tower man, the Tower, Ile root them out.   _Exit Gloster._

 _Queen._ Ah _Ned_, speake to thy mother boy? ah   [eau087]
 Thou canst not speake.
 Traytors, Tyrants, bloudie Homicides,
 They that stabd _Cæsar_ shed no bloud at all,   ·eau090·
 For he was a man, this in respect a childe,
 And men nere spend their furie on a child,
 Whats worse then tyrant that _I_ maie name,   [eau093]
 You haue no children Deuils, if you had,
 _T_he thought of them would then haue stopt your rage,   ·eau095·
 But if you euer hope to haue a sonne,
 Looke in his youth to haue him so cut off,
 As Traitors you haue doone this sweet young prince.

 _Edw._ Awaie, and beare her hence.

 _Queen._ Naie nere beare me hence, dispatch   [eau100]
 Me heere, heere sheath thy sword,
 _I_le pardon thee my death. Wilt thou not?
 Then _Clarence_, doe thou doe it?   [eau103]

 _Cla._ By Heauen I would not doe thee so much ease.

 _Queen._ Good _Clarence_ doe, sweet Clarence kill me too.   ·eau105·

 _Cla._ Didst thou not heare me sweare _I_ would not do it?

 _Queen._ I, but thou vsest to forsweare thy selfe,
 Twas sinne before, but now tis charitie.
 Whears the Diuels butcher, hardfauored _Richard_,   [eau109]
 Richard where art thou? He is not heere,   [eau110]
 Murder is his almes deed, petitioners
 For bloud he nere put backe.   [eau112]

 _Edw._ Awaie I saie, and take her hence perforce.

 _Queen._ So come to you and yours, as to this prince.   [eau114]
               _Ex._

 _Edw._ _Clarence_, whithers _Gloster_ gone?   [eau115]

 _Cla_ Marrie my Lord to London, and as I gesse, to   [eau116]
 Make a bloudie supper in the Tower.

 _Edw._ He is sudden if a thing come in his head.
 Well, discharge the common souldiers with paie
 And thankes, and now let vs towards London,   [eau120]
 To see our gentle Queene how shee doth fare,   [eau121]
 For by this I hope shee hath a sonne for vs. _Exeunt Omnes._


SCENE XXII.

Enter _Gloster_ to king _Henry_ in the Tower.

 _Glo._ Good day my Lord. What at your booke so hard?

 _Hen._ I my good Lord. Lord _I_ should saie rather,
 Tis sinne to flatter, good was little better,
 Good _Gloster_, and good Diuell, were all alike,
 What scene of Death hath _Rosius_ now to act?   ·eav005·

 _Glo._ Suspition alwaies haunts a guiltie mind.

 _Hen._ The birde once limde doth feare the fatall bush,
 And I the haplesse maile to one poore bird,
 Haue now the fatall obiect in mine eie,
 Where my poore young was limde, was caught & kild.   ·eav010·

 _Glo._ Why, what a foole was that of Creete?
 That taught his sonne the office   [eav012]
 Of a birde, and yet for all that the poore
 Fowle was drownde.   [eav014]

 _Hen._ _I Dedalus_, my poore sonne _Icarus_,   ·eav015·
 Thy father _Minos_ that denide our course,
 Thy brother _Edward_, the sunne that searde his wings,
 And thou the enuious gulfe that swallowed him.   [eav018]
 Oh better can my brest abide thy daggers point,
 Then can mine eares that tragike historie.   ·eav020·

 _Glo._ Why dost thou thinke _I_ am an executioner?

 _Hen._ A persecutor _I_ am sure thou art,
 And if murdering innocents be executions,
 Then I know thou art an executioner.

 _Glo._ Thy sonne I kild for his presumption.   ·eav025·

 _Hen._ Hadst thou bin kild when first thou didst presume,
 Thou hadst not liude to kill a sonne of mine,
 And thus _I_ prophesie of thee.
 That manie a Widdow for her husbands death,
 And many an infants water standing eie,   ·eav030·
 Widowes for their husbandes, children for their fathers,
 Shall curse the time that euer thou wert borne.
 The owle shrikt at thy birth, an euill signe,
 The night Crow cride, aboding lucklesse tune,   [eav034]
 Dogs howld and hideous tempests shooke down trees,   [eav035]
 The Rauen rookt her on the Chimnies top,
 And chattering Pies in dismall discord sung,
 Thy mother felt more then a mothers paine,
 And yet brought forth lesse then a mothers hope,
 To wit: an vndigest created lumpe,   ·eav040·
 Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree,
 Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast borne,
 To signifie thou camst to bite the world,
 And if the rest be true that I haue heard,
 Thou camst into the world   He stabs him.   [eav045]

 _Glo._  Die prophet in thy speech, _I_le heare   [eav046]
 No more, for this amongst the rest, was I ordainde.

 _Hen._ _I_ and for much more slaughter after this.
 O God forgiue my sinnes, and pardon thee.   He dies.

 _Glo._ What? will the aspiring bloud of _Lancaster_   ·eav050·
 Sinke into the ground, _I_ had thought it would haue
               mounted,   [eav051]
 See how my sword weepes for the poore kings death.
 Now maie such purple teares be alwaies shed,   [eav053]
 For such as seeke the downefall of our house.
 If anie sparke of life remaine in thee,    Stab him againe.   [eav055]
 Downe, downe to hell, and saie I sent thee thither.
 I that haue neither pittie, loue nor feare.
 Indeed twas true that _Henry_ told me of,
 For _I_ haue often heard my mother saie,
 That I came into the world with my legs forward,   [eav060]
 And had I not reason thinke you to make hast,
 And seeke their ruines that vsurpt our rights?
 The women wept and the midwife cride,   [eav063]
 O Iesus blesse vs, he is borne with teeth.
 And so I was indeed, which plainelie signifide,   ·eav065·
 That _I_ should snarle and bite, and plaie the dogge.
 Then since Heauen hath made by bodie so,
 Let hell make crookt my mind to answere it.
 I had no father, _I_ am like no father,
 I haue no brothers, _I_ am like no brothers,   [eav070]
 And this word _Loue_ which graybeards tearme diuine,
 Be resident in men like one another,
 And not in me, I am my selfe alone.
 _Clarence_ beware, thou keptst me from the light,
 But I will sort a pitchie daie for thee.   ·eav075·
 For I will buz abroad such prophesies,   [eav076]
 As _Edward_ shall be fearefull of his life,
 And then to purge his feare, Ile be thy death.
 Henry and his sonne are gone, thou Clarence next,   [eav079]
 And by one and one I will dispatch the rest,   ·eav080·
 Counting my selfe but bad, till I be best.
 Ile drag thy bodie in another roome,
 And triumph _Henry_ in thy daie of doome.      _Exit._


SCENE XXIII.

Enter king _Edward_, _Queene Elizabeth_, and a Nurse with the young
prince, and _Clarence_, and _Hastings_, and others.

 _Edw._  Once more we sit in England’s royall throne,   [eaw001]
 Repurchasde with the bloud of enemies,
 What valiant foemen like to _Autumnes_ corne,   [eaw003]
 Haue we mow’d downe in tops of all their pride?
 Three Dukes of _Summerset_, threefold renowmd   [eaw005]
 For hardie and vndoubted champions.
 Two _Cliffords_, as the father and the sonne,
 And two _Northumberlands_, two brauer men
 Nere spurd their coursers at the trumpets sound.
 With them the two rough Beares, _Warwike_ and _Montague_,   ·eaw010·
 That in their chaines fettered the kinglie Lion,
 And made the Forrest tremble when they roard,
 Thus haue we swept suspition from our seat,
 And made our footstoole of securitie.
 Come hither _Besse_, and let me kisse my boie,   ·eaw015·
 Young _Ned_, for thee, thine Vncles and my selfe,
 Haue in our armors watcht the Winters night,
 Marcht all a foote in summers skalding heat,   [eaw018]
 That thou mightst repossesse the crowne in peace,
 And of our labours thou shalt reape the gaine.   ·eaw020·

 _Glo._ _I_le blast his haruest and your head were laid,   [eaw021]
 For yet I am not lookt on in the world.
 This shoulder was ordained so thicke to heaue,
 And heaue it shall some waight or breake my backe,
 Worke thou the waie, and thou shalt execute.   ·eaw025·

 _Edward._ _Clarence_ and _Gloster_, loue my louelie Queene,   [eaw026]
 And kisse your princelie nephew brothers both.   [eaw027]

 _Cla._ The dutie that _I_ owe vnto your, Maiestie,   [eaw028]
 I seale vpon the rosiate lips of this sweet babe.

 _Queen._ Thankes noble Clarence worthie brother thankes.   ·eaw030·

 _Gloster._ And that I loue the fruit from whence thou   [eaw031]
 Sprangst, witnesse the louing kisse I giue the child.
 To saie the truth so _Iudas_ kist his maister,
 And so he cride all haile, and meant all harme.

 _Edward._ Nowe am _I_ seated as my soule delights,   ·eaw035·
 Hauing my countries peace, and brothers loues.   [eaw036]

 _Cla._ What will your grace haue done with _Margaret_,   [eaw037]
 _Ranard_ her father to the king of _France_,   [eaw038]
 Hath pawnd the _Cyssels_ and _Ierusalem_,   [eaw039]
 And hither haue they sent it for her ransome.   [eaw040]

 _Edw._ Awaie with her, and wafte hir hence to _France_,
 And now what rests but that we spend the time,
 With stately Triumphs and mirthfull comicke shewes,
 Such as befits the pleasures of the Court.
 Sound drums and Trumpets, farewell to sower annoy,   ·eaw045·
 For heere _I_ hope begins our lasting ioie.
               _Exeunt Omnes._


FINIS.
